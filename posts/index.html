                <p>Three thoughts from a week of calorie counting on a low carb diet, with no pre-planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s frustrating, like all of a sudden finding yourself in a community of people that don&rsquo;t speak your language.</li>
<li>Sustaining a feeling of hunger, or quenching it with water, sometimes comes with a weird feeling of gratitude for the comfortable life you&rsquo;ve built for yourself.</li>
<li>At the end of the week that burger you like at your local establishment, that you&rsquo;ve had many times, tastes infinitely better.</li>
</ul>

<p>International Business Machines Chief Executive Arvind Krishna said the tech giant has used artificial intelligence, and specifically AI agents, to replace the work of a couple hundred human resources workers. As a result, it has hired more programmers and salespeople, he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Replacing HR with AI seems like a positive development to make it totally clear that HR is there to protect employer, not employees.</p>

<p>When I wrote up <a href="https://samgrover.com/2025/03/14/yesterday-it-dawned-on-me.html">Piterator.swift</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day">Pi Day</a> earlier this month, I was actually trying to do something with the values it returns but I didn&rsquo;t get around to that fun part due to lack of time.</p>
<p>A few days after that I imagined a clock face where the seconds hand moves in jumps of the values returned by the iterator at the rate of once per second. So as the values start coming in like 3, 1, 4, etc, the second hand jumps by those many seconds.</p>

<p>The app will still be available in the App Store and continue to work. If I decide to remove it completely, I will give at least one month&rsquo;s notice.</p>

                <p>Yesterday it dawned on me that it was Pi Day Eve, so obviously, I whipped up a little Swift iterator that iterates over values of Pi from <a href="https://pi.delivery">Pi Delivery</a>. You can get it at <a href="https://gist.github.com/samgrover/1b5493bfd62849b6b2d730f5b6b1e61a">this gist</a>.</p>
<p>Use it in your swift code and make fun stuff using the value of Pi up to 100 trillion digits!</p>
<p>Happy Pi Day!</p>

<p>On Friday, I met up with some friends for happy hour. I got there early and was waiting when this guy noticed that I had a camera on me and asked for a photo. He was in a group that seemed to have come by after playing soccer.</p>

<p>Over the last few evenings, I built my first mallet. As I was making it, I made a big mistake, but I went on making it. I made other smaller mistakes but in the end I have a mallet, that, while not perfect, is a nice addition to my tools. I will only build better mallets in the future.</p>

<p>My valentine, my wife of nearly eleven months, is such an inspiration to me in so many ways. She inspires me to be a better husband and man, and to take better care of myself.</p>
<p>I want to especially call out her incredible determination over the last couple of years to running regularly. She took it upon herself to start running again after a long pause. I recall how hard it was for her to train up to running her first 5K, and then her first quarter marathon. Later that same year, with an amazing effort, she ran her first half marathon, followed one year later by her second one.</p>

                <p>After building <a href="https://samgrover.com/2025/01/02/basement-storage-shelves.html">storage shelves</a> towards the end of the year, I turned my eyes to the other side of that area and decided to build a workbench there. The idea being that it would house my new 3D printer, and also have room for other projects that I didn&rsquo;t want to do in the dusty environment of the woodworking area. I drew up a rough plan on a photo and it came to 12 feet by 2 feet.</p>

                <p>The previous release had the ability to see your list of collections. This new one adds the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add photos to collections from the list of recent uploads. Tap and hold a single photo, or use the &ldquo;…&rdquo; menu on en entry that has a batch of photos to add them all.</li>
<li>Delete a photo from a collection. When browsing a collection, tap and hold on a photo to see the option to delete.</li>
<li>Create a collection. Just tap &ldquo;+&rdquo; on the collections list.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding this way of managing my collections to be great. Hope you like it too!</p>

                <p>I enjoy podcasts but I got the feeling I was listening to a lot of tech. In 2024, I reduced the time to about 50%. In 2023 they were close to 65%.</p>

<p>Maybe I can get it down to 40% this year.</p>

                <p>Over the last week or so I designed and built freestanding storage shelves in our basement. Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8w7XGiVMbs">this video</a>, and other similar ones, I decided that I would give it a go.</p>
<p>The basement had become a mess of stuff, about 70% of which was worth keeping. So we started by re-organizing what we wanted to keep and the rest we discarded/donated/gave-away.</p>
<p>On the 23rd I drew up the plan, and we went and bought the first set of materials from a <a href="https://52ndhardware.com">neighborhood building material store</a>, which has amazing people. Then came the holiday, so I didn&rsquo;t start to build until the 26th.</p>

                <p>I enjoy reading but realized that this activity had reduced in my life. So this year I made a concerted effort to read more, and it worked. I&rsquo;ve found that the key to my enjoyment of reading is to read a variety. So I mix books that are short, long, fiction, non-fiction, old, new, most-often read genres and others.</p>
<p>On average I&rsquo;m reading smaller books than before, but I&rsquo;m reading a whole lot more of them, as seen in these charts.</p>

I was hoping to get a better idea of the interest in the community once I remove the barrier to entry. Initially there were a lot of downloads, and sessions. Now, some months later, according to analytics that Apple provides, there is almost no change in usage.</p>

                <p>Glad that I&rsquo;ve found a new use for now-obsolete long Lightning cables: With an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B091GSRCBR/">adapter</a> they can be used for charging the plethora of micro-USB devices. So much better than the six inch cables included with those.</p>

<p>This was something I&rsquo;d considered but dismissed as I was working on the earlier versions of this feature. However a <a href="https://micro.blog/maique/44515709">recent discussion</a> has changed my mind.</p>
<p>Sometimes the stars align and eager feedback from 90% of users (i.e. 4 people) comes at just the right time when I have availability, and also the architecture of the app supports adding it quickly, so I built it!</p>

                <p>Over the last week I&rsquo;ve explored <a href="https://www.lux.camera/introducing-process-zero-for-iphone/">Halide app&rsquo;s new Process Zero</a> (PZ) feature.</p>
<p>For the first couple of days I misunderstood what the PZ image was and how to get it. I even <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@sam/112974328939642307">tooted</a> a comparison of a RAW image processed by me along with an &ldquo;Apple Processed&rdquo; image, both captured in Halide. Apparently I wasn&rsquo;t the only one confused, as per the discussions in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShotWithHalide/">official subreddit</a>.</p>
<p>I thought that the PZ adjustments were in the RAW file but they are actually only in the HEIC / JPG file, that is &ldquo;developed&rdquo;, and essentially redeveloped every time one makes adjustments in the app&rsquo;s Image Lab interface.</p>

                <p>This version introduces a modernized, intuitive, and faster upload flow which takes you from uploads to recent uploads with zero taps!</p>
<p>The new flow unifies the uploads screen and the recent uploads screen into the main app screen. This provides immediate access to your uploads right after uploading for so you can move on to exporting or adding alt text right away!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m loving this new design very much and I hope you like it too.</p>

<p>This was taken at about the same time and location as <a href="https://samgrover.com/2024/07/03/astoria-oregon-th.html">another photo I shared last week</a>, but I only saw it recently when I received film scans.</p>
<p>I like this composition a lot more. The shadows balance the mural wall, there are fewer rooftops in the frame and they are below the railing, the colors better reflect the feeling of that morning on the rooftop.</p>

<p>I like to tell people that everything an LLM says is actually a hallucination. Some of the hallucinations just happen to be true because of the statistics of language and the way we use language.</p></blockquote>

<p>This beta introduces a modernized and faster upload flow which takes you from uploads to recent uploads with zero taps!</p>
<p>The new flow unifies the uploads screen and the recent uploads screen into the main app screen. This provides immediate access to your uploads right after uploading so you can move on to exporting or adding alt text right away!</p>

                <p>Last night, just before I slept, a thought occurred to me and I visualized a photograph in my head. I woke up at 4:30am, and as the pre-dawn light started to illuminate the room, that photo popped back into my head. I couldn&rsquo;t get back to sleep and finally got out of bed at 5 AM.</p>
<p>I had some coffee and as the sun rose in a mostly cloudy sky, I decided I was gonna go and try to take that photo. I drove to the location, walked around to see the perspectives, and finally took the photo, and a couple more for good measure.</p>

                <p>When Perseverance rover landed on Mars, it brought along a little helicopter in its belly. The helicopter, named Ingenuity, was a 30-day technology demonstration sent to see if we could fly an aircraft in the very thin Martian atmosphere.</p>
<p>As is often with NASA&rsquo;s robotic missions to Mars in recent times, it did that, and exceeded all expectations. It became a companion to the rover and performed about 70 flights over the nearly three years that it flew on Mars. Then last month it encountered an accident that left one of its propeller damaged. That <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/9540/after-three-years-on-mars-nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-ends/">ended the mission</a>.</p>

<p>The hike is a loop and has a quick ascent going clockwise, then some ups and downs with the last mile or so pretty much flat. It was a very enjoyable hike that had wonderful views, and provided a nice workout with the variations.</p>

                <p>Gradually, then suddenly coming to the conclusion that the only way forward for Mimi Uploader is via a subscription model to support development and ongoing costs. And to offer that via various tiers to emulate a sliding scale for supporters.</p>
<p>It is tricky to make a subscription service or otherwise charge specifically for the AI image description feature even though it has ongoing cost. That&rsquo;s because in many scenarios you don&rsquo;t get the service you pay for, and it is out of my control. For example:</p>

                <p>A new beta of Mimi Uploader is now out. It adds a new feature to generate a draft of an image description for use as alt text. An example is at the end of this post. This feature is opt-in. You have to ask for an image description to be generated each time. If you don&rsquo;t then the app behaves as before.</p>
<p>Thank you for trying this out in the beta, which <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/AbjtGWge">you can join at this link</a>.</p>

This one adds a feature to generate alt text for a photo based on OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT 4 Vision model, which is a paid service.

<p>A couple weekends ago we went hiking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latourell_Falls">Latourell Falls</a>. It&rsquo;s a lovely hike that has immediate view of the lower falls from the trailhead. There&rsquo;s a short hike to the base of the lower falls. There&rsquo;s also a separate loop hike that goes up and around those falls and comes across the higher falls. That&rsquo;s the one we did.</p>
<p>Along the way we saw a number of mushrooms, some huge Devil&rsquo;s Clubs (identified by the phone), and a whole lot of moss and trees. It&rsquo;s a popular hike. There were people all along the way.</p>

                <p>This is about an iOS/iPadOS app I make, called <a href="https://samgrover.studio/apps/mimi">Mimi Uploader</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-past">The Past</h2>
<p>This is all from memory, so let me apologize in advance for any errors/omissions.</p>
<p>The concept of Mimi Uploader as an app came about gradually. First I started using Micro.blog regularly. I like putting together sets of photos, so I often have posts with those. Soon thereafter I realized it was a pain to manage uploading a series of photos for a post. Thankfully Micro.blog provided an API. So I wrote a python script that would do that from the command line on my Mac, and that greatly eased the friction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Engineers at the company work an average of roughly 45 hours/week; it is not a sweat shop like stereotypical gaming companies, but it is not a 9-5 job either.</p></blockquote>
<p>While many are fighting for progressive work environments in tech, regressive ones are not only out there, but are also proud of it.</p>

                <p>Some sonic explorations with modular synthesis.</p>
<p>Listener beware: It&rsquo;s a bit rough round the edges 😆</p>
<p>Just before the 10 minute mark I came across some fun computer-voicey sounds so I settled in to relish those with minor variations until the end.</p>

<p>Recorded directly with iPhone camera and mic so the sound is not the best it can be. Someday I expect to do a better job at recording the actual sound.</p>

<p>The announcements at the event and the hot takes around it have gone around the internet, and the world, perhaps a dozen times by now. This is not a post about that, but about my personal experience.</p>

                <p>Our house has five steps to get down to the backyard. A few weeks ago, a board on the top step cracked on the edge. I added some blue tape to make it more visible until I got around to fixing it.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/454e484af8.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/454e484af8.jpg" alt="Front view of steps. There’s blue tape on a board on the top tread."></a></p>
<p>Soon thereafter I started working on a plan to fix it. The simplest thing would be to replace the board but many other boards are also not in good shape, so a fresh set would be best, especially since I may be getting some painting work done and a fresh coat on this could be added to that. Once I decided to go with that I felt like I had to address the fact that the treads are held up by two stringers, and there really ought to be three. This was starting to feel like yak shaving but I hadn&rsquo;t taken on a project like this in a while and it was appealing to spend the time to do it right.</p>

                <p>Some time ago I wrote about a simple app I made to export routes for workouts so that I can embed them in <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/05/11/hike-at-lacamas.html">blog posts</a>, or <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/03/12/an-app-for.html">Google Maps</a>.</p>
<p>Well, I kept making improvements to it to the point that now it looks like an interface to my workouts that I prefer over the standard one from Apple (like supporting light and dark modes 🙄).</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you be interested in using it? Should I start a beta so you can share how you <em>really feel</em>?</p>

                <p>A couple of weeks ago we went hiking at Lacamas Park in the city of Camas, about 20 minutes drive from Portland. This was our first time there and it was a lovely hike in a park that is well maintained and has lots of crisscrossing trails.</p>

<p>A few times I got the feeling of being farther from the city than we actually were, like when the trail drops down to the base of a waterfall.</p>

                <p>I use an Apple Watch to track my activities, whether that be workouts or recreational. For outdoor activities, the watch records location data throughout the activity. This is later shown on a map in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitness/id1208224953">Fitness app</a> on the iPhone. While that map is interactive, exporting it only exports a low resolution image, and not the actual route.</p>

<p>When I share an activity on a blog post I like to show the map but I don&rsquo;t like the idea of just sharing an image of the map. I would like to get the actual data out so that it can be overlaid on an interactive map using various mapping tools.</p>

                <p>I was thinking about getting more of those AcuRite sensors for expanding my <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/03/01/home-climate-monitoring.html">home climate monitoring</a> when I realized that I already have a couple of devices recording this and other data.</p>

<p>These include my <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZnOfFX">Ecobee Thermostat and Remote Sensor</a> and my <a href="https://amzn.to/41MeiIK">IQAir AirVisual Pro</a>. Both of these have means of getting the data off of them using an API. This <a href="https://den.dev/blog/air/">blog post</a> by Den Delimarsky really helped with the IQAir API. <a href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/developers/">Ecobee API</a> was straightforward. And after some coding and testing, I had a couple of scripts running that could pull metrics from them and send them to <code>influxdb</code>. So now I have a few more data points for existing metrics, and have added air quality to it.</p>

I thought that was cool and it introduced me to several hardware and software tools that I had not known about. I wanted to set this up at my home so I filed a project for a later date.</p>

The theater had cozy seats and serves brunch so that made it a little extra fun.</p>

<p>After reading it, I couldn&rsquo;t help but clarify a few things about the origin story 😬</p>
<p>Quoting from the article,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a town that has been less than welcoming to Walmart, it may be a bit of head-scratcher how they wound up with a regional technology office here. The answer, like so many other regional offices in town, is through acquisition.</p>

First fix is for that annoying issue in the alt text editor where the text you&rsquo;re editing goes under the keyboard 😬</p>

                <p>I was playing with the <code>pandas</code> library on <code>python</code> and picked the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/">IMDb dataset</a> to explore.</p>
<p>To give myself a learning goal, I asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What movies are generally regarded as the best that have multiple directors?</p></blockquote>
<p>After some finagling the dataset (of multiple large CSV files) I arrived at the following list of twenty, in descending order of average rating:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0133093">The Matrix</a> (1999) • 8.7<br>

                <p>In the last week of our recent trip to India, Jenni and I went on an overnight trip from New Delhi to Agra to visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>.</p>
<p>We arrived at the site a couple hours before sunset so the Sun was about halfway down which meant that as we walked around the campus, and the light changed color, we could see it all on play out the Taj. This was especially delightful. The primary stone in the construction is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makrana_marble">Makrana marble</a>, which is famous for being strong and translucent.</p>

                <p>A few years ago we did a bike ride that went along the Columbia Slough and some wetlands to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelley_Point_Park">Kelley Point Park</a> which is at the confluence of the Wilamette and Columbia rivers. At the time it was the longest bike ride either of us had done. We have recalled that ride fondly over the years. Today, on a very pleasant and sunny Fall day, we did it again!</p>

                <p>Hot on the heels of the release of the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2022/07/15/first-images-from.html">first images from JWST</a>, the team also <a href="https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDATA/JWST+Data+Release">released the data</a> used to create those final images.</p>
<p>I downloaded some images of the Carina Nebula dataset and was enthralled by these intermediate black and white images. I love how crisp they are.</p>

                <p>Steamboat Rock is the main feature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Rock_State_Park">Steamboat Rock State Park</a>, located by Banks Lake in central Washington. It has been an annual camping destination for Jenni&rsquo;s family for decades. This month was my first time there. We spent three nights at the campground there and had a wonderful time exploring the park and especially hiking up the rock.</p>
<p>The weather forecast had said that there may be thunderstorms with lightning the morning we were thinking of hiking up, but fortunately that warning moved to later in the day, so we got going a little before 10am.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a little solar powered helicopter on Mars. It&rsquo;s named Ingenuity and it has a little camera on its belly that looks downwards. This video has every image taken by that camera from the first one on April 3, 2021 (Sol 43) until today. Ingenuity is 19 inches (0.49m) tall and weighs 4 lbs (1.8kg).</p>

                <p>Recent Uploads used to show only the uploads you make from Mimi Uploader. With the new update it will also show uploads made to your Micro.blog account from anywhere else.</p>
<p>Mimi is primarily a batch uploader and that is my favorite way of using it. I like to make blog posts that have a set of photos, and making that process smoother was the motivation to create Mimi in the first place. As such, each batch of photos shows up in Recent Uploads as a set.</p>

I think this looks much better. An added benefit is that I can also add the icon to the filter menu on the top right so that the meaning becomes obvious.</p>

                <p>Every morning I come into the living room and sit on the sofa and my brain says, &ldquo;Wordle&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;m soon playing that game. This has been going on for months.</p>
<p>Last week I went camping for three nights and I didn&rsquo;t think of Wordle a single time. The morning after I returned I went into the living room and sat on the sofa and my brain said, &ldquo;Wordle&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy how much of a pattern recognizer and responder the brain is, and how it makes these long lasting habits. Break a pattern briefly, lose a habit briefly.</p>

                <p>A query for computer keyboard people.</p>
<p>After a few days with an ErgoDox EZ I borrowed from a friend, I&rsquo;m realizing that I:</p>
<ul>
<li>like the split and the tenting.</li>
<li>also like the added flexibility of an additional layer or two.</li>
<li>currently don&rsquo;t want to change from the standard layout of keys that I&rsquo;m used to.</li>
<li>continue to like mechanical keys, and am open to non-clicky ones.</li>
<li>could give or take ortholinear layout.</li>

                <p>A little over a year ago Jenni and I made this wall mounted cookware hanging rack.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/29b5bd2792.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/29b5bd2792.jpg" alt="Boards mounted on a wall horizontally, with hardware mounted to the boards and pans and decorative items hanging off the hardware."></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been wanting a place to put our pans for a while It&rsquo;s tedious to manage them in a drawer or cabinet, if you can even fit them in there. Often some would just stay on the stove and need to be moved out of the way when cooking. Whenever I would see pans hanging, in person or in a photo, it seemed like the best solution. We had space on only one wall in the kitchen, so that decision was easy.</p>

<p>As I was taking these photos I was thinking how I prefer the 2x for compositions when it comes to zoom. 3x is handy but I have so many years of composing in ~50mm (2x on iPhone). Alas, iPhone 13 Pro can only do 2x with a crop on 1x image. Here I thought the tradeoff was worth it.</p>

                <p>Recent Uploads currently shows the uploads you make from Mimi Uploader. After the next update it will also show uploads made to your Micro.blog account from anywhere else 🎉</p>
<p>Mimi is primarily a batch uploader and that is my favorite way of using it. I like to make blog posts that have a set of photos, and making that process smoother was the motivation to create Mimi in the first place. As such, each batch of photos shows up in Recent Uploads as a set.</p>

<p>As part of this project, I also started using a &ldquo;real&rdquo; video editor. I&rsquo;ve edited videos in the past using iMovie, but this was quite different, as expected, and it was fun to pick up a lot of the beginner level skills in the process.</p>
<p>The editor I used was DaVinci Resolve, mostly because it has a version available for free and it is a very capable app for video editing on the Mac.</p>

                <p>Before our return to Portland from Tucson, I was really looking forward to flying over Arizona and Utah because there are so many landscapes there that I adore and have seen from the ground as well.</p>
<p>And the views did not disappoint! Here are a few along with my best guess for the place.</p>

                <p>I went on a photowalk with my friend Andrew today and got to try a really old Leica lens that he found in a thrift store recently. It was a <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/leica/135mm-f45.htm">Leitz Hektor 135mm f/4.5</a> and was probably made in the 1950s.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable how I can just attach this nearly 70 year old lens to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_M10">Leica M10</a>, a modern digital camera made just a few years ago. I&rsquo;ve read how Leica M maintains compatibility with the oldest products but today I got to try out. It just works!</p>

                <p>I was having mixed feelings about Season 2 of Ted Lasso but E5 removed all doubt. It is clear that the show is self aware, and I think they are the best when they are unabashedly joyous. I posit that E4 felt a bit weird because they don&rsquo;t need a Christmas setting to manifest joy.</p>

                <p>💰 Financial (Pro?) Tip for US based folks: You can get a free credit report from the main bureaus via <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/">annualcreditreport.com</a>. Once per year per bureau. I’ve been getting them regularly for years to review what creditors have on file. However I get a report from each of the three bureaus every four months. That way I have a little insight into my credit every four months and I can spread them out to once per year per bureau so they are always free. The site can feel a little clunky but it is a good resource IMHO.</p>

                <p>Achievement Unlocked: Dust on iPhone 12 Pro 1x camera sensor 😭</p>

<p><strong>Update (9th August, 2021):</strong> I took it in to the Apple store today after making an appointment at the Genius Bar. They took it in for an hour and repaired it. Not sure if they replaced the entire 1x camera module but the issue is gone 🎉</p>

<p>That day it was a foggy with columns of rising steam visible. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is common there but it sure added to the spookiness of the name.</p>
<p>As in many parts of the Oregon coast there were rock formations of various sizes that dot the landscape and make it ever more interesting than just a sandy beach.</p>

                <p>I built a wall-mounted rack for a bathroom and am quite happy with how it turned out.</p>

<p>The bathroom on the main level in our house is used occasionally by us. It is also the one that is used by visitors. It has never had a good place to put stuff. The sink doesn&rsquo;t have enough room on it for anything besides the soap, and there is no vanity cabinet in which to put things. We decided a long time ago that there needed to be something.</p>

                <p>A new beta of Mimi Uploader will be coming your way shortly. This includes layout updates for the main screen for all screen sizes and orientations.</p>
<p>It also includes a new button to toggle viewing images in their entirety. Here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/2e3a58cc07.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/2e3a58cc07.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>On the left is the way images will show by default, but tapping the new button in the bottom toolbar scales the images so they fit in their available space, as shown on the right.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m trying out a new image layout algorithm for the main screen on Mimi Uploader. The idea is to utilize more of the screen real estate and to adjust the size of each photo based on the total number.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a before/after in the portrait orientation.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s one in the landscape orientation.

<p>I&rsquo;m quite encouraged by this and already finding it useful in development.</p>

                <p>A new version of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">Mimi Uploader</a> is now out with my favorite new feature in a while. <strong>You can now access your Recent Uploads for reference or export!</strong> 🎉</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/5627108d83.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/5627108d83.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Recent Uploads can be accessed by the icon on the top left of the main screen. Once in there, you can see a list of your ten most recent uploads sessions. Each of those can be independently exported to get the URLs in Markdown or HTML. Now if you miss exporting right after an upload, or somehow lose the exported text, you can still get to it later. I hope you enjoy this feature and find it useful like I do.</p>

<p>And here is a photo of the pergola that is in the garden, adjacent to the fence. It is a really nice space and we&rsquo;ve been enjoying using it, and look forward to spending more time there, even with friends!</p>

<p>I usually need this on macOS and have a terminal handy so a Python script works well for me. You could extract the logic and make a different automation out of it, e.g. an iOS Shortcut. Do share if you do :-)</p>

<p>Today they released a set of high definition videos from various cameras that captured the descent and landing in amazing detail. This is a first and wow, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4czjS9h4Fpg">that footage is incredible</a>!</p>
<p>NASA also released the first ever audio recorded on another planet. Today I heard the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nasa/first-sounds-from-mars-filters-out-rover-self-noise">breeze on Mars</a>. Amazing!</p>

                <p>About a week ago we were at the beginning of a &ldquo;historic&rdquo; winter storm. It had waves of various kinds of precipitation. Snow, sleet, ice, freezing rain, rain.</p>
<p>At the end of it there was the thickest layers of ice on everything that I&rsquo;d ever seen in these parts.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/de1b0dab31.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/de1b0dab31.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>We lost power on Sunday night at 7pm. Thankfully, it was restored on Monday at 1:30pm. At one point we emptied the fridge of perishables and placed them in a cooler outside. At least there was plenty of ice around to keep things cold 😄. I&rsquo;m grateful that this was a minor inconvenience to us compared to what many others are going through with recent weather.</p>

                <p>Yesterday I finished reading The Broken Earth Trilogy by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._K._Jemisin">N.K. Jemisin</a>.</p>
<p>I read the first book last year. I was sufficiently intrigued that I bought the second book soon after, but for whatever reason I didn&rsquo;t start reading it until a couple of months ago. Fortunately it starts in a way that helped recall the story within the first few chapters. It then built upon the world and the characters as any good middle book. Once I&rsquo;d finished that, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to read the third one. I bought it right away and read it voraciously over the last two weeks. It did a great job of tying it all together and was very satisfying.</p>

                <p>Last year <a href="https://samgrover.com/2019/05/26/we-made-a.html">we built a gardening bed</a> in the spring and used it for summer vegetables and for garlic over the winter. A bed in that region of our yard did a lot better than our existing beds, especially for tomatoes, so we decided that we would build a new one next to it in 2020.</p>
<p>Well, last weekend we built that new gardening bed. It&rsquo;s the end of the main vegetable growing season but it is also the time to plant garlic. The ones from last year came out great. Apparently you should rotate the bed you use for garlic, so that became the impetus to get the new one set up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been intrigued by the idea of a video doorbell for some time now. Mostly out of technological curiosity, and sure, a little bit out of a need for convenience. We didn&rsquo;t even have a doorbell, so people visiting or leaving packages would simply knock on the door which was easy to miss.</p>
<p>At the same time, the prominent products made by large tech companies constantly stream video data from a doorbell to their servers for analysis and trade. That wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted.  So I was on the lookout for a product that would keep the video data local to my home network. It would still send data over the internet to my device if I wanted to access it, or respond to a doorbell ring, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be sending significant amounts of data that is of no value to me but has value to the surveillance industry.</p>

                <p>Yesterday was one of those amazing Fall days when the sky is clear and the air is crisp. After going through ten days dealing with wildfire smoke, and another few days of overcast skies and much-needed rain, it was a welcome change. So, we went out for a short hike in <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Tolinda-Ridge_Trail_Loop_Hike">the Forest Park area</a>.</p>
<p>There are nice views from the trail. This is at a viewpoint very close to the start. St John&rsquo;s Bridge, with Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Rainier in the distance.</p>

                <p>The new version requires iOS 14 and utilizes its new system photo picker. This enables you to easily browse and search your entire library to add photos to upload. You are no longer restricted to the recent few thousand photos.</p>
<p>As a result of this change Mimi no longer requires or asks for Photos permission. Yay for privacy! You will never be prompted for that again. Only the photos you explicitly add will now be accessible to Mimi and shown in the grid.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been having a lot of smoke from wildfires in the state. It&rsquo;s an emergency and has been reported about in major news so I won&rsquo;t go into details. We&rsquo;re taking care and staying indoors until the AQI improves, which is expected in a couple of days 🤞</p>

                <p>For various reasons, I&rsquo;ve not been able to give Mimi the time and attention I&rsquo;d hoped over the last several months, but I&rsquo;m actively trying to change that. I&rsquo;m working on an update that takes a fresh approach to the photo selection flow by utilizing new features coming in iOS 14.</p>
<p>iOS 14 has a powerful new system provided photo picker that lets users pick photos from their library. The new picker has great features for browsing, searching, making multiple selections, etc. This is perfect for apps like Mimi where people can pick the photos they want to upload with minimum friction and with an experience that feels true to iOS. I&rsquo;m very conscious of privacy in apps, so it gives me great joy to note that with this new picker Mimi will no longer need to ask for Photos permission.</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I constrained myself to photos taken on that day. No digging into the archives.</li>
<li>A lot of these were taken around the house or the neighborhood, i.e. the pandemic life.</li>
<li>There was one day where I took a photo but forgot to post and posted the next morning. So there goes my 30 day photo blogging pin on Micro.blog. Again 🤦‍♂️</li>
<li>Some days I kinda winged it, as can be seen 😬.</li>
<li>This photo challenge was managed by <a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2020/07/23/august-photoblogging-challenge.html">@macgenie</a>.</li>
<li>The last one I did was the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2020/03/02/all-my-february.html">February photoblogging challenge</a>.</li>

                <p>We wanted to adopt a kitten from the <a href="https://www.oregonhumane.org">Oregon Humane Society</a>. In these days of the pandemic, their adoption process has changed and you&rsquo;re only allowed to apply online. So we checked their website regularly. That&rsquo;s when we noticed that demand is very high these days so the window to apply was very short. New kittens would get posted but by the time we noticed and applied, they would already have been spoken for. This went on for a week or so.</p>

Recently I figured it was a good time to re-evaluate how it&rsquo;s working out. So here are some similar lists as last time. Apps are listed in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Apps I&rsquo;m currently using on a regular basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>MarsEdit</li>
<li>Timing</li>
<li>Unite</li>
<li>iStatMenus</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps I use occasionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downie</li>
<li>Dropshare</li>
<li>Expressions</li>
<li>Folx</li>
<li>Marked</li>
<li>MindNode</li>
<li>Permute</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps that I&rsquo;ve used just once or twice or briefly for a project. These were handy when I needed them and now I know they&rsquo;re there and can use them again if a similar need arises.</p>

<p>Ashish Grover, or Ashu, as we called him endearingly passed away on Monday, 6th July, 2020 in New York City. His passing was sudden and unexpected. It has shaken up our entire family across two vast countries. He was only 48. Now he will forever be 48.</p>
<p>Technically he was my cousin, but we grew up under the same roof in New Delhi, our mothers cooked side by side in the same kitchen, we ate at the same table. I shared his room for a while in the 80s, as our growing joint family was on the verge of becoming a nuclear one. He was my brother.</p>

We try and go each year around this time when the roses are in full bloom. It never disappoints, even with an overcast sky. Of course it was a little different this year, as with everything else.</p>

                <p>A couple of days ago I finished reading <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780441478125?aff=samgrover">The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin</a>. It was published fifty-one years ago, but feels like it could&rsquo;ve been this year. A wonderful and timeless story written with immaculate detail, and emotional depth. There were many sentences all over the book that I read more than once because they were worth savoring.</p>
<p>I first heard of Ursula K. Le Guin a long time ago. At the time I thought of her as a Fantasy author, and I used to think of myself as someone that enjoys reading Sci-Fi, but not Fantasy. It was an arbitrary distinction that I hope is behind me. But as a result I didn&rsquo;t introduce myself to her work even though she was frequently mentioned in the context of Sci-Fi. I hope to read more of her works in the future.</p>

                <p>Just saw two great examples of tech activism.</p>
<p>First was an Instagram story where all you had to do was swipe up and that opened a webpage which then brought up an email composer filled out with an email and with email addresses populated. You just had to update placeholders with your info and hit send.</p>
<p>Second is this bot that requests people to update their black square photos on Instagram so that they don&rsquo;t drown out actual black voices using the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag: <a href="https://github.com/char/blm-instagram-bot">github.com/char/blm-&hellip;</a></p>

                <p>About three months ago I heard of someone using a trackpad with their non-dominant hand at their Mac. Now I&rsquo;d heard of such a use before but this time I had a trackpad lying around. I&rsquo;d gotten it with my Mac instead of a mouse because I already had a mouse, but had stashed it away. So I got it out and set it up for my left hand.</p>
<p>A month passed. I was using it rarely. One day the battery in my mouse ran out in the middle of the workday, so I plugged it in and moved the trackpad over to the right side.</p>

                <p>A day off from work was a good idea. We went for a hike at Coyote Wall.</p>

<p>The trails have a gentle grade and there’s plenty of room to distance ourselves when we come across other people.</p>

                <p>Inspired by Patrick Rhone&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/reading/">/reading</a> page, I&rsquo;ve created a <a href="https://samgrover.com/books/">Books page</a> on my site.</p>
<p>Following is the process I followed to make that happen on my Mac:</p>
<ul>
<li>Export all my books out of Goodreads. You can find the page to do that by navigating to &ldquo;My Books&rdquo; and selecting &ldquo;Import and export&rdquo; at the bottom of the left sidebar under &ldquo;Tools&rdquo;. The exported file is of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV format</a>, which is pretty standard.</li>
<li>Open the export file in a spreadsheeting app. I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/numbers/id409203825?mt=12">Numbers.app</a>. Here, you can clean up any data. I added some ISBNs that were missing. I also saved this file so I can just update it in the future as I read books. Another reason I went through this step was because I was having a hard time parsing the original CSV file using the script I wrote.</li>
<li>Export the spreadsheet file as CSV.</li>
<li>Run it through the script below to generate Markdown that can be pasted directly into the page on my site.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it!</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I constrained myself to photos taken on that day. No digging into the archives.</li>
<li>A lot of these were taken around the house or the neighborhood. I work from home and tend to go on walks at various times during the day.</li>
<li>Some days I took the photo but forgot to post and posted the next morning.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t usually do photo challenges, daily or otherwise, so this was harder than I expected. Some days I kinda winged it, as can be seen 😜.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mimi is designed from the ground up to enable super fast uploading of photos from your device to your Micro.blog hosted blogs. Utilize Mimi to upload a set of photos for making your blog post. Maybe a road trip, or a party, or memories of a special day.</p>

                <p>As of the last several years, I’ve spent a lot less time gaming than before. I&rsquo;m basically an occasional gamer. It is with that in mind that I recently sold my PS4 which was lying unused, and bought a subscription to Apple Arcade that let&rsquo;s me play games on several devices and for short windows of time.</p>
<p>I’ve played a few games on it now, and by far my favorite has been “<a href="https://www.whatthegolf.com">WHAT THE GOLF?</a>”. I don’t think I’ve had as much fun playing a game in a while. I fire it up a few times a week on my iPhone and make a little progress each time. It is interesting, inventive, clever, and above all, hilarious. I’m 77% through the game and savoring the last of it. I hope this team makes more games and I look forward to them.</p>

<p>Update: I&rsquo;m aware that some parts are missing detail that is present in the original set. I did this real quick. Might fix those up later.</p>
<p>Update 2: I didn&rsquo;t realize that these photos were taken at difernt times and represented a before and after view, so to speak. Here&rsquo;s another panorama that shows the view after the rover had wandered about a bit.</p>

<li>Noting how often you open bags that sound like they contain chips.</li>
<li>That song you&rsquo;re humming.</li>
<li>Noting how often you sniff, or cough, or clear your throat.</li>
<li>Noting the sounds your appliance makes, to detect the make and model, or the settings you use.</li>
<li>Noting how often you answer your phone, as opposed to declining the call.</li>
<li>Noting which notifications are you most likely to respond to by picking up and unlocking your phone.</li>
<li>That deep breath you just took after a particular notification rang on a particular device.</li>
<li>That bag of chips you opened a short while after you took that deep breath.</li>

                <p>A couple of weeks ago we went on a bike ride on the <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Banks-Vernonia_Traverse_Hike">Banks Vernonia State Trail</a> on the outskirts of the Portland metro area. It was a lovely Fall day. We started at Banks Trailhead, rode for a while past the Buxton Trestle bridge, and then returned the same way. A lot of the way was flat and some parts had a gentle slope. We had a great time. Following are some photos from then.</p>

                <p>Part of my gym routine involves using a treadmill. And each time after I complete that, I take a photo of the readout.</p>
<p>This morning I took one with my new iPhone 11 Pro and got the following photo.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/d9b9918c82.jpg" alt="Clipped"></p>
<p>As you can see, parts of the readout were invisible or clipped. I think it is because the speed of the default camera app in those conditions is just too fast in comparison to the refresh rates on that LED readout. The cameras can go really fast with shutter speeds, but there’s a lot of computational photography involved, so the final composite shutter speed may vary.</p>

                <p>I switched my weather complication from Dark Sky to built-in Weather and my Apple Watch Series 4 battery life dropped in half. Consistently over two full charge cycles. I made no other change to the configuration or my routine. Needless to say, I&rsquo;ve switched back.</p>

                <p>I’ve been using a <a href="https://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbay-4">OWC Thunderbay 4 (Thunderbolt 2)</a> external enclosure with four 3 TB hard disk drives for the last two years. I bought it on eBay as a new but opened product. It’s been great. I had two of the drives in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_0">RAID 0</a> configuration (for higher bandwidth single volume) and they were serving as the primary storage of about 1 TB of photos.</p>
<p>Recently I decided to partially upgrade that setup by purchasing a Crucial 2 TB SSD. In order to install it I also had to purchase a <a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/MEQX3TRAY/">OWC Spare Drive Tray</a> since the ones in my Thunderbay didn’t have the right setup for 2.5” drives. That took a few days to arrive. In the meantime I installed the SSD into an old USB LaCie enclosure and moved my files over to it.</p>

It was a lovely campground just off the beach amongst many trees. I don&rsquo;t recall having visited the coast in such nice weather. The town of Newport was a short bike ride away and we rode our bikes around parts of it as well. Following are some photos.</p>

<p>Two and a half years ago, my lower back had gotten so bad that I couldn&rsquo;t walk for more than a few minutes at a time without having to stop to sit or squat. Then came surgery, recovery, return of ability, and progression from there on. Yesterday I hiked up <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Dog_Mountain_Hike">Dog Mountain</a>. It was the most strenuous hike I&rsquo;ve ever done. And as I sit here all sore the next day, I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful to be able to do that.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m feeling a love-hate relationship with activity streaks. While it is nice to have a streak and motivating to keep it going, I feel some anxiety coming along with it.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/26478fd52c.jpg" alt="March activity streak"></p>
<p>So, in an effort to avoid the unhealthy side effects, I am going to willfully break streaks.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/e08e076050.jpg" alt="April activity streak"></p>
<p>This one has gone for some time. And today I&rsquo;m ending it.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/bb473b1bda.jpg" alt="May activity streak"></p>
<p>A positive effect of a streak is that it helps to develop a habit, and I&rsquo;d like to think that it has been the case this time. Let&rsquo;s see if that lasts.</p>

<p>The mail and keys organizer located just inside our home entrance had to go. It couldn&rsquo;t handle our lifestyle, by which I mean, hold a bunch of mail of varying sizes for a bunch of days. Oh, and some keys and the super long IKEA shoehorn (the best!).</p>
<p>I began to dream up a new replacement as a woodworking project. I made a Pinterest board to get some design inspiration.

<p>Last weekend we went hiking at <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Coyote_Wall_Hike">Coyote Wall</a>. Jenni and I had never been to this hike before but our friends were familiar with it.</p>
<p>There are multiple trails that meet each other at various points. Some are gentle slopes, while others are steeper. One can pick and choose paths based on how much of a workout one wants and switch that around as needed.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve been journaling in <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> for some time now. I like it for a lot of reasons, and it&rsquo;s working out great. So far I&rsquo;ve been using it as a plain old journal, where you write what&rsquo;s on your mind. Recently, I decided that I wanted to get my digital history into it as well. One of the first things that came to mind was my <a href="https://foursquare.com">Foursquare/Swarm</a> checkin history which goes back to 2009. I decided to start there.</p>

<p>This is not a review of Setapp, but rather my initial experience with it after having heard about it a few times on the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/">Mac Power Users</a> podcast. Many of apps in the Setapp catalog are well known and as such I was already aware of them. But there are several that are new to me.</p>

<p>Last Saturday we went hiking at <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Angels_Rest_Hike">Angel&rsquo;s Rest</a> in the gorge. I&rsquo;ve been on this hike several times and always enjoy it. It is only a thirty minute drive from home, and offers great views and a good workout.</p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/88bb5df549.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This trail, along with many others had been closed for over a year since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Creek_Fire">Eagle Creek Fire</a>, and had reopened last fall.</p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/a49110943e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>All the way from the trailhead to the viewpoint on the top of the cliff there were charred trees. I&rsquo;ve never hiked through a place devastated by fire before, so it was a new an interesting experience from that regard.</p>

<p>Jenni wanted a shelf in the kitchen to organize things a little better and I wanted to make different kinds of boxes. That&rsquo;s how this came to be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a beginner woodworker and always on the lookout for new projects that I can use as an excuse to learn new skills, and let&rsquo;s be honest, to buy new tools. For this project I ended up buying a new blade for my table saw. One that has teeth with flat tips to make a flat cut, so that the finger joints fit snugly.</p>

                <p>Is there a way to create a link (like an alias) from Finder to an album that lives in Photos? So that opening it, basically navigates to that album on Photos. Natively, or via Automator. Not seeing a way to do either. Drag and drop does an export.</p>

                <p>Is there a way to save a session in Safari? I have twelve tabs in a window regarding a project, and I want to shift to another project that has a different set of tabs. Would be nice to save and restore sessions. I don&rsquo;t want multiple windows or a solution involving that. Ideas?</p>

                <p>On 11th February in 2015, I decided to buy a house in Portland.</p>
<p>At the time I was working on my laptop at Hivolt, a coffee shop in New Orleans. I ordered a cup of pourover coffee named Burundi Buziraguhindwa. The menu described it as “natural sundried, juicy, strawberry, raspberry”. Turned out to be one of the best coffees I’ve ever had. It was the catalyst, because a few minutes later I had made the decision. When I told Jenni about it, she started calling it “magic coffee”. I love her.</p>

                <p>Today I turned thirty-four.</p>
<p>Here are some personally memorable events since <a href="http://blog.samgrover.com/2009/10/11/thirty-three/">my last birthday post</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>March - Liz and I spent a weekend at Newport on the Oregon coast. The highlight was the visit to the Oregon Coast Aquarium. Also, after three-and-a-half years at Intel, I left to join Small Society to make cool iOS apps. I started at Small Society on 22nd March.</li>
	<li>June - While in LA, Liz had to undergo emergency surgery for the removal of her ruptured appendix. She returned home a week after that and has recuperated well. Got an iPhone 4 which has a decent enough camera that for the first time ever I'm comfortable with my phone being the only camera on my person when I travel.</li>
	<li>July - I had to fly down to LA and drive our car back from there since we flew Liz up to Portland after her surgery. Traded in the MINI for a Subaru Outback.  We had to [let Yoshi go](http://blog.samgrover.com/2010/08/01/goodbye-yoshi/).</li>
	<li>August - My parents visited us in Portland and we had a great time showing them around Portland. We also visited Seattle, Crater Lake and Bend.</li>
	<li>September - Visited Disney World in Florida for ten days. It was a vacation for us and a chance for my parents to meet Liz's parents for the first time. We all had a great time there. I also visited family in Chicago for a few days.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was another amazing year and I’m looking forward to the next one.</p>

                <p>It was less than a year ago that we said hello to <a href="http://blog.samgrover.com/2009/09/29/yoshi/">Yoshi</a>. Unfortunately and unexpectedly now it&rsquo;s time to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Yoshi started to show symptoms of great discomfort yesterday morning and we noticed blood in his urine shortly before noon. We immediately called his regular vet but they were about to close and asked us to go to <a href="http://www.lvhvet.com/">Laurelhurst Veterinary Hospital</a> (LVH) instead. So off we went. After his examination the doctor informed us that he is having urinary tract issues. He&rsquo;s had other health issues earlier this year. The doctor informed us that since he is having these issues really early in his life, he will need constant medical attention and care in the future. Their best treatment recommendation greatly exceeded what we can afford right now. Combined with other unexpected financial events from this summer and the expected upcoming travels, it soon became apparent that we would have to make a hard decision. We informed the doctor of our predicament. She offered that they have a process in place to adopt a pet in such a circumstance, to nurse them back to health and put them up for adoption. With great sadness we decided to surrender Yoshi to their care. This way he gets the best, immediate, and adequate care and will find a new home with someone who can address his future needs as well. There are no words for our heartfelt gratitude to the folks at the LVH for adopting him into their care.</p>

                <p>This blog post is long overdue and if you&rsquo;ve been following me on Twitter of Facebook, this is old news for you and you can just go ahead and skip to the last paragraph.</p>
<p>In March I left Intel to start working at <a href="http://smallsociety.com/">Small Society</a>. This has been an interesting and welcome change in my life and career. I was working on really cool computer security research at Intel Labs. However, on the side, I was gaining strong interest in developing apps with Cocoa on the Mac and iPhone OS platform ever since I started working on that over a year ago.</p>

<p>This book is a treatise on human culture, with an emphasis on faith and spirituality. It is sci-fi as set in contemporary 21st century. The book can feel a bit dated, and it helps to imagine the US in the 60s to get some perspective. I particularly enjoyed the early experiences of Mike Smith (the &ldquo;Man from Mars&rdquo;) as he encounters human civilization for the first time and tries his best to &ldquo;grok&rdquo; it. His discoveries present interesting quirks of humanity that make one chuckle and laugh. Laughter itself makes a revealing impression on Mike.</p>

<p>Here are some personally memorable events since <a href="http://blog.samgrover.com/2008/10/11/thirty-two/">my last birthday post</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>December - Liz and I traveled to Asia. In India, we had our New Delhi wedding. In Nepal we visited Liz's home and friends in the Himalayas and in Bali we had our honeymoon. Pictures are [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/collections/72157618568809607/).</li>
	<li>January - Returned from trip to Asia. Bought a HDTV and a PS3. Been enjoying glorious Blu-Ray and some cool games since then.</li>
	<li>February - Started working on Avatari. My first Mac application in Cocoa. Had my first car accident. It was minor.</li>
	<li>April - Demoed and released [Avatari](http://samgrover.com/software/) at Demolicious. Liz and I went road-tripping thru the southwest. Visited Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, Monument Valley and Grand Canyon. Some of the most amazing landscapes I've ever seen. Pictures are [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157618655198144/).</li>
	<li>May - Liz and I went to Bend for a long weekend and had a great time exploring this cute little town and its surrounding volcanic geology.</li>
	<li>June - I became a [US permanent resident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_residence_%28United_States%29). No more visa hassles!</li>
	<li>August - Liz and I traveled to Kaua'i where we had a great time celebrating our first anniversary. Pictures are [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157622166004781/).</li>
	<li>September - Completed ten years of living in the US. Brought [Yoshi](http://blog.samgrover.com/2009/09/29/yoshi/) (our cat) home. My first pet ever. Bought an Olympus E-P1 to use as my primary camera succeeding the Bessa in that role.</li>
</ul>
It was an amazing year and I’m looking forward to the next one.
<p>And lastly, here’s more about the number <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_%28number%29">33</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had my suspicions that I would enjoy having a cat as a pet. A month ago those suspicions were confirmed, and now I have my first pet ever.</p>
<p>Liz and I had the pleasure of hanging out in Kaua&rsquo;i for about a week (See pictures <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157622166004781/detail/">here</a>!). We stayed at some friends&rsquo; place while they were on vacation. There were two house cats around, Woodrow and Wilson. At the end of that week I realized that I really enjoyed having a pet around. Liz had been keen on the idea for a while, so we decided to look for a kitty to adopt as soon as we got back.</p>

                <p>Sometime last week, Liz and I saw Martin Scorsese’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=The%20Aviator&amp;tag=thapnasasbl-20&amp;index=dvd&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">The Aviator</a>, a biographical film about Howard Hughes. At the end of the movie I remarked that the Hercules flying boat, designed by Hughes, and shown in the film is on permanent display in our Oregon neighborhood. A few minutes of online searching later we decided to go check it out at the <a href="http://www.sprucegoose.org/">Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum</a> in McMinnville on the weekend.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve returned to using Netflix this year and it&rsquo;s working out great for Liz and me, both film lovers. Here are some thoughts on my recent Netflix experience.</p>
<p>I noticed the other day that when Netflix shows me ratings for a movie that I haven&rsquo;t rated (the red stars), it is not showing me what I thought that was. The red stars show me what Netflix thinks I will rate the movie rather than the average of what others have rated. It is a prediction. This is <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2007/10/your-profile-page.html?showComment=1191954420000#c4039331185929945585" target="_self">not news</a>, but is news to me. I don&rsquo;t like it. I&rsquo;d like to see the average rating given by others instead of the predicted rating for me. I&rsquo;ve taken to hovering over each film&rsquo;s title or image to get that information. It&rsquo;s annoying but doable and I prefer it to the misleading red stars.</p>

                <p>I released an update for Avatari two weeks ago. Since then I&rsquo;ve found a few blog posts talking about it. See them <a href="http://www.genbeta.com/mac/avatari-para-cambiar-facilmente-tu-avatar-en-mac-os-x">here</a>, <a href="http://www.soydemac.com/2009/06/15/avatari-te-ayuda-a-cambiar-rapidamente-de-imagen/">here</a>, <a href="http://messenger.es/avatari-cambia-tu-avatar-en-multiples-redes-sociales-y-aplicaciones_5085">here</a> and <a href="http://www.moongift.jp/2009/06/avatari/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Did you check those out? I did and found that none of them are in a language I know!</p>
<p>So, what do I do? Well, there&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s language tools which can translate foreign language pages to a language of your choice. Google has <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate_buttons">handy bookmarklets</a> for many languages. Find yours and set it up in the bookmark bar in your browser. When you&rsquo;re at any website in a foreign language, just click that button for a quick translation. Awesome!</p>

                <p>A couple of weeks ago I finished reading Michael Pollan&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143038583?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thapnasasbl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0143038583">The Omnivore&rsquo;s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals</a>. The book is about food production and agriculture in the US. It is also about man&rsquo;s relation to food and to the culture of eating. This is not a review of the book, but rather a summary of my thoughts on this subject as it relates to my personal health and habits.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve just released Avatari version 0.2.2. This is a minor release. It preserves avatar file type when uploading to a service. It also improves and simplifies the user interface design when adding a new account. Many thanks to my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/ubercolin">@ubercolin</a> for his suggestions regarding these improvements.

                <p>Mike Johnston, over at <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/">T.O.P</a>, writes interesting posts quite often. He has recently written a couple of them that hit close to home. They are <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/05/a-leica-year.html">The Leica as Teacher</a> and <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/05/why-it-has-to-be-a-leica.html">Why It Has To Be a Leica</a>. Mike suggests a training program using the Leica for a year to shoot <abbr title="Black and White">B&amp;W</abbr> film extensively and to edit and critique oneself on the photos taken. I&rsquo;ve tried to do exactly that over the last two years.</p>

                <p>Yea, the last few posts on this blog have all been about Avatari. Life, as usual, is way more varied. Here&rsquo;s a recap of some travels and photos from the last few months.</p>
<p>Late last year, Liz and I traveled to Asia. We visited her Nepalese home near Kathmandu, had our second wedding of the year in New Delhi and then went to Bali for our honeymoon. That&rsquo;s a whole &rsquo;nother blog post that one of us will eventually write on <a href="http://samandliz.wordpress.com/">our blog</a>. Oh, but the pictures are ready to go in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/collections/72157618568809607/">Asia 2008 collection</a> on Flickr.</p>

<p>You wanted AddressBook and iChat support. It is here!</p>
<p>I wanted more web services to adopt an API for uploading avatars. <a href="http://shizzow.com/">Shizzow</a> responded with enthusiasm. That support is here too!</p>
<p>By enabling AddressBook and/or iChat support, entries appear in the account list for each of those. When you are ready to update your avatar, just select them if you want to update those too.</p>
<p>If you use iChat for Google Talk, then setting your avatar in iChat will update your avatar on Google&rsquo;s servers the next time you connect or immediately if you are already connected. Google then updates your avatar across all their services including Gmail, Google Profile, etc.</p>

Avatari is an application to update your avatars across the Internet with one click.
<p>I keep my avatar the same most of the time but every now and then I would replace it for a short period to represent a holiday or a cause or some event. When I would do that it would annoy me that I had to go to each individual location where I had uploaded my avatar for a brief replacement.</p>

It has been a little over eight months since I [bought the Wii](http://blog.samgrover.com/2008/03/16/time-to-play-again/). Even though my best video game experiences have been on a PC, the Wii holds its own and is a pleasure to play.
<p>I started with the wonderful Super Mario Galaxy and it was the only Wii game I played until a couple of months ago. Then, for five days each, I rented Transformers, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, one after another. And although I didn&rsquo;t really get in to Brawl, I thoroughly enjoyed the other two.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ve never blogged about my birthday before, which is strange because I&rsquo;ve had thirty-one of them. A few seconds ago I turned thirty-two.</p>
<p>Here are some personally memorable events since my last birthday:</p>
<ul>
	<li>October - Made a trip to India for dad's 60th birthday celebration.</li>
	<li>January - Got all four of my wisdom teeth extracted. Two had to be dug out. Was on a soup diet for a couple of weeks.</li>
	<li>February - Created the first version of the [LazyEngine](http://lazyengine.appspot.com/).</li>
	<li>March - Asked Liz to marry me. She said yes. Bought a Wii. The engagement was decidedly more memorable, but the Wii has been fun too :-)</li>
	<li>April - Attended a concert by Zakir Hussain and met him.</li>
	<li>May - Went to the hot springs at Brietenbush. Sis and niece came over to visit. We all had a great time.</li>
	<li>June - Moved to a new place right next to the river in NW Portland. Liz spoke at Ignite Portland 3.</li>
	<li>July - Liz and I made a [trip to Maine](http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/our-trip-to-maine/) to visit her parents and to spend the 4th of July holiday with them. Later that month, I traveled to Porto, Portugal to attend a conference. Lovely little city. It was my first time in Europe.</li>
	<li>August - Liz and I had our [Portland wedding](http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/we-got-married/). Our New Delhi wedding is in December. We went to Crater Lake for a weekend. Beautiful place. Our first time there. I traveled to San Francisco to showcase my work.</li>
	<li>September - I hacked together [ff2tweet](http://github.com/samgrover/ff2tweet/tree/master). Hope to refine it further in the future.</li>
</ul>
It was a wonderful year and I'm looking forward to the next one.
<p>And lastly, here&rsquo;s more about the number <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32_(number)">32</a>.</p>

                <p>I got sick of reposting to Twitter what I had just posted to FriendFeed. I was doing that to enable conversations in both networks. I tried twitterfeed and Yahoo! Pipes, before deciding to just write a tool to do exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>ff2tweet is a tool to convert a FriendFeed post into a tweet and post it to Twitter. It does so while ensuring that the tweet is within the character limit and incorporates any comment made by the user when posting on FriendFeed. It also inspects the link in the post to shorten and add to the tweet as necessary.</p>

                <p>As I mentioned in my <a href="http://blog.samgrover.com/2008/06/19/whats-going-on/">last post</a>, (over two months ago!) I went to Portugal for a trip towards the end of July. I was attending the <a href="http://secrypt.org/">SECRYPT</a> conference and presenting my paper there. All I knew about Porto, was what I read on Wikipedia and other places online. I was looking forward to a cute historic European city and that&rsquo;s exactly what I got.</p>

<p>My sister and her daughter came by to visit me from India last month. They were here for about a week and we all had a great time going around the Portland metro area and nearby to the gorge and coast. Here they are at Cannon Beach.</p>

Around the end of May, my landlord and I had a disagreement on the terms for a lease renewal at my current place. So, I decided to move out and started looking for a new place. I found a nice two bedroom condo [right by the river](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=620+NW+Naito+Pkwy,+Portland+OR+97209&amp;mrt=all&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=45.528178,-122.672825&amp;spn=0.009275,0.017252&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr) in NW Portland and will be moving there this weekend.
<p>I got a paper accepted to a conference called <a href="http://secrypt.org/">SECRYPT</a>. I will be going to present it at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto">Porto, Portugal</a> during the last few days of July. I just applied for a Visa and am looking forward to my first trip to Europe.</p>

                <p>About three months after its <a href="http://blog.samgrover.com/2008/02/16/announcing-lazyengine/">initial launch</a>, I&rsquo;m happy to announce a new version of <a href="http://lazyengine.appspot.com/">LazyEngine</a>. I have moved it off my domain and onto the recently launched <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. This involved a rewrite of the code from the original PHP into the new Python version. This does not mean that it is any less lazy ;-)</p>
<p>I had wanted to add a feature to remember a user&rsquo;s past searches but was too lazy to implement that in PHP. With the new version, I get user logins automatically. You can use your Google accounts to log into LazyEngine and have it remember your searches from visit to visit. Give it a shot right now at <a href="http://lazyengine.appspot.com/">http://lazyengine.appspot.com/</a>. Enjoy!</p>

When I was a kid, I enjoyed tapping on tables in the style of a [Tabla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla) player. The sounds were fun. My mom used to say that I should learn the instrument. I never did. I think that was for the best since I don't seem to have any talent in playing a musical instrument.
<p>Even in those young days I had heard of the music of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakir_Hussain_%28musician%29">Ustad Zakir Hussain</a>. Zakir is regarded as the foremost player of the Tabla in the world. He has achieved unparalleled recognition and mastery with the Tabla and is a household name in India. Last night, Liz and I went to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlene_Schnitzer_Concert_Hall">Schnitz</a> for a concert by Zakir Hussain and the Masters of Percussion. It is an annual event hosted by <a href="http://www.kalakendra.org/">Kalakendra</a>. The group does a tour each year and the musicians change regularly. It was such beautiful and wide ranging music from a dozen different instruments of various Indian Classical schools. I was enthralled by the solo and group performances, especially the Tabla, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarangi">Sarangi</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitar">Sitar</a>.</p>

<p>On March 21st, I asked Liz to marry me and she said yes. She was elated that I asked her on a full-moon vernal equinox ;-)</p>
<p>We are both very happy and excited. I don&rsquo;t know who all read my blog, so probably you&rsquo;ve already seen me mention this on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/2361035615/">Flickr</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/samgrover/statuses/776347132">Twitter</a> or in an email.

                <p>The last time I bought a gaming console was in November, 2001. It was an Xbox. For the last six years, I&rsquo;ve used it exclusively as a DVD player.<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2342/2338648273_62e9c8d0b2_m.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_wii">Nintendo Wii</a> today. They are still in short supply. The local <a href="http://fredmeyer.com/">Fred Meyer</a> does a raffle when they get some stock. Last night they got twelve units. The raffle was scheduled for 6:45am today, fifteen minutes before opening time. I was first in line. Eleven people showed up. Everyone got a Wii.</p>

                <p>Steve Novick is running a really cool campaign for U.S. Senate here in Oreon and it&rsquo;s great that Liz is part of it. They just released a <em>campaign beer</em> called &ldquo;Left Hook Lager&rdquo;.

<p>On the subject of voting in general, I get the impression that people are so casual about <a href="http://samgrover.tumblr.com/post/27449669">counting the votes</a>. It&rsquo;s great to see The Onion impart its inimitable style to <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/74800">the issue</a>.

                <p>There was some discussion today on Twitter regarding the first website made by people. That got me to look into my archives for the first one that I made.

But the second one that I made was hosted on the servers at <a href="http://www.pdx.edu/">PSU</a> and still exists on the aforementioned machine <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815110854/http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~satyajit/">here</a>.

                <p>For the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve had a new personal assistant, <a href="http://iwantsandy.com/">Sandy</a>. I came to her after trying Backpack, Remember the Milk, Stikkit and others that I don&rsquo;t even remember any more. She&rsquo;s the best one I&rsquo;ve had so far. She makes me want her more. So far my girlfriend is cool with that, even though Sandy lives right here in Portland.</p>
<p>This weekend I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica_%2528film%2529">Helvetica</a>. I got excited when I noticed that Movie Madness had it on their list but it was never in stock when I got there. On Saturday it wasn&rsquo;t on the shelves either, but Liz suggested that I peruse the un-shelved DVDs and there it was. I&rsquo;ve never thought about the history behind types. This film was enjoyable just for that. And there&rsquo;s a lot more about typography and graphic design in there. To top it all, the film is set to a really cool soundtrack.</p>

                <p>It was heavier than I expected. I had ignored my cardinal law in purchasing a camera, &ldquo;Hold it in your hands to see how it feels&rdquo;. One year has gone by with me using <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/357893935/">the Bessa</a> exclusively, and I love it.</p>

<p>I bought it along with a 50mm Nokton f/1.5 lens and an adapter. The camera has an M mount, whereas the lens is a screw mount, so I needed an adapter. My plan was that if I liked this enough I could get an M mount Leica lens in the future and it would fit just fine with the camera. I still plan on doing that. Perhaps a 35mm lens, but more on that later. I bought this Bessa at <a href="http://cameraquest.com/voigtr2ar3a.htm">CameraQuest</a>, a website that I haven&rsquo;t visited since then. I never planned on buying more of this system and I never had any issues.</p>

                <p>Ever since I heard &ldquo;Lawyers, Guns and Money&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve wanted to hear more of <strong>Warren Zevon</strong>&rsquo;s music. So this week I bought &ldquo;The Best Of Warren Zevon&rdquo; at <a href="http://amazonmp3.com/">Amazon&rsquo;s MP3</a> store. I&rsquo;ve listened to it twice and now there are a few more of his songs that I really like.</p>
<p>A new favorite song is <strong>Lily Allen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alfie&rdquo;</strong> which I first heard way back, and then again recently on the podcast of the wonderful NPR show, <a href="http://npr.org/allsongs">All Songs Considered</a>. It&rsquo;s quite pop-ish.</p>

<p>That move was simple. Now I have to move to my new place in real space this weekend. Unfortunately, that will involve some more work! Portland has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland%2C_Oregon#Sections_and_neighborhoods">five quadrants</a>. Yea, five. Portland is weird. I used to live in the Southwest and then I was in the Southeast for the last 18 months and now I will be moving into a small house in the Northeast. It will increase my daily commute, but overall it will be great! By the way, the fifth quadrant is North, in case you were wondering.</p>

                <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I updated this blog. About ten months. I&rsquo;ve been an intern at Intel during that period and I recently joined as an employee.</p>
<p>Also, now it&rsquo;s been one year since I moved to the SE Portland. I like it here. I have a hour-or-so long commute each way on <a href="http://www.trimet.org/" title="TriMet">TriMet</a>, which isn&rsquo;t terribly bad as it gives me time to read. However, public transit doesn&rsquo;t work too well when there are more things to do in a day, especially in different parts of town. Even though my schedule at work is quite flexible, public transit can become a bottleneck. That occurs when I want to do more than go to work in the morning and return home in the evening. I thought that was sufficient excuse for me to go in for a car ;-) and placed an order for a new Mini Cooper S in April. I expect to have delivery within a month and am looking forward to that. It will be my first car.</p>

                <p>Amazon started offering downloadable movies a couple of weeks ago. That&rsquo;s great, especially since they offer rentals. I prefer to rent movies since I usually only see a movie once. If I feel like watching it again and again, I would buy it. In that case, I wouldn&rsquo;t buy a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management" title="DRM">restricted</a> downloadable file and wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it either, especially with <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/09/15/amazon_unbox_to_cust.html" title="Eat shit and die">draconian agreements</a>. I&rsquo;d rather just buy the physical DVD at an affordable price. You can&rsquo;t just give a restricted file to a friend and say, &ldquo;Hey, check this out. It&rsquo;s cool&rdquo;.

                <p align="justify">I was on my short commute today when I got a text message from my father in India. It said, " ... All ok in Mumbai. You may not be able to contact them as lines jammed ...". He was referring to my sister and her family. I didn't know what to make of this. I thought that perhaps the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5163288.stm" title="Hindu hardliners riot in Mumbai">Sunday incident</a> had flared up. I hadn't read the news this morning, so I called him and he told me about the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5169332.stm" title="Scores dead in Mumbai train bombs">bomb blasts</a>. Seven bombs went off on board various trains of the western lines within one hour (<a href="http://lastingnews.com/maps/mumbai_terror.php" title="Mumbai attacks">Mapped locations</a>).

                <p>I don't have any major need for spreadsheets, so I'm definitely not inclined to buy some software for it. But there are a few little things for which I could use one and that is why it's great to see a free web application from Google that provides it.</p>
<p>I started to use <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/" title="Google Spreadsheets">Google Spreadsheets</a> yesterday and found it very convenient and simple to use. It offers some basic functionality for now but that's ok since it's only a limited test. It can import and export <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLS" title="Microsoft Excel">XLS</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" title="Comma Separated Values">CSV</a> files at the moment, so I converted my few files from a simple text format into CSV and they were smoothly imported. The application looks quite slick. This is the first application from Google that looks a lot like a desktop application. It has menus near the top with similar items as a standard desktop application. There are buttons for the usual suspects; Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo and Redo. It has collaborative features to let multiple users edit the same file and provides a chat interface too. I haven't tried that yet. I'm looking forward to more such applications. I'm guessing that I'll use some of them while others I won't, picking and choosing depending on usage, usability and desktop alternative availability.</p>

The camera is a <a href="http://www.cameraquest.com/canql17.htm" title="Canonet QL17 G-III">Canonet QL17 G-III</a>. I've gone through one roll on it and it's been fun to use so far. I had been using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera" title="Single Lens Reflex camera">SLR</a> cameras until now and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangefinder_camera" title="Rangefinder camera">rangefinder</a> is quite different in operation. The major difference being that the image viewed through the viewfinder is not the same as the one that is seen by the lens. In an SLR you see through the lens, so it's more of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</a> interface.

                <p>I like reading, but unfortunately, I don't get much time to read for pleasure these days. Adding to that sorry state of affairs is the fact that I'm a slow reader. When I do read nowadays, it is more of <a href="http://samgrover.wordpress.com/tag/non-fiction/" title="My blog entries about non-fiction books">non-fiction</a>. On those rare occasions that I do read fiction, I love a good short story.</p>
<p>Apart from being concise, short stories stay focused and leave a lot to the imagination. They appeal to the minimalist in me. They build around a key idea or theme and my favorite kind have a twist or climax at the very end. An extreme and wonderful example is Ernest Hemmingway's six word story: &quot;For sale: Baby shoes. Never used&quot;.</p>

It is based on Anthony Burgess' book of the same name. It is one of my favorite movies and I had never seen it in a theater. So, off I went for a dose of the ultraviolence.</p>
<p align="left">The theater manager informed us that it was the largest turnout in their current series of classic films. The print was an original one, scratches and all. There was even a bit of trouble with it towards the end, which caused a pause in the show. That brought on comments, the likes of which are only heard when the audience comprises fans of a cult classic.</p>

<p>The first is <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/asc/">All Songs Considered</a>. It is hosted by Bob Boilen (sometimes in conversation with guests) and features newly available music from various artists.

My cousin sent me some scans of old photos. She is the little one in the pictures. These are from 1986/7 and were taken at our house in New Delhi. We all used to live as a joint family, ten to fifteen people spanning three generations in one house. Anyway, the photos brought back memories and I wrote about each one of them on flickr.

"Search" is defined quite broadly and includes the coming realm of ubiquitous computing. Google is a major focus of the book, and its influence and growth surely warrant that focus.</p>
<p align="left">What motivated me to read this book was the concept of the "[Database of Intentions](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000063.php)". It refers to the ability of an ubiquitous search technology to extract the intention of one or more of its users by analyzing their interactions with a plethora of devices. That is absolutely fascinating and will be quite something when it is realized. Needless to say, it will be the Oracle of the information age. It is an update on the idea of the Memex described by Vannevar Bush in "<a title="As We May Think" href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/pub/vbush/vbush.shtml">As We May Think</a>", which is cited in the book.

The time came from shunning TV. I don&rsquo;t miss it. I recommend it. The money required was less than what would have been necessary in a pre-digital age. That made it affordable. <a title="flickr" href="http://flickr.com">flickr.com</a> has been a great influence as it has provided me with a community with whom to share, discuss, and enjoy photography.

The book is about the author's efforts to understand the human brain's mechanism for intelligence and to apply it to machines. He presents a model of intelligence called the memory-prediction framework.</p>
<p align="left">This was perhaps the first time I had read a somewhat detailed analysis of the possible mechanism that drives human intelligence. Some concepts that I found especially interesting were that of invariant and hierarchical memory. Also, the idea that the brain predicts all actions before they are executed was fascinating. If the subject interests you, I highly recommend it. It is quite readable.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, after all these days I have returned to find that blogger is lacking in features. On the other hand, <a href="http://www.wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a> has launched recently and that is looking pretty cool. So, I&rsquo;m moving to <a href="http://samgrover.wordpress.com/">samgrover.wordpress.com</a>. Maybe I&rsquo;ll be back  or move somewhere else another day, leaving trails in cyberspace as time goes on.</p>

They are awesome. Today there is <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/07/21/crazy_tiled_animated.html">a post on BoingBoing</a> involving stick figures. Oh, and also see <a href="http://www.stickfigureninja.com/display.php?galtype=3&amp;page=1&amp;picID=1">this</a> stick figure recreation of  the Weapon of Choice video by Fatboy Slim. Enjoy!</p>

                <p>Ever since I switched recently and for a little while before that too I have been following news about Apple. There is an interesting article on Robert X. Cringley&rsquo;s &ldquo;I, Cringley&rdquo; page about the future of Apple following the creation of a separate iPod division. Mr. Cringley evaluates it in relation to a 20 year old quote from Steve Jobs. Interesting items include <i>&ldquo;What most people don’t know is that Apple, with the assistance of Intel, a few years ago ported all its software to run on Intel’s Pentium processors.&quot;</i></p>

                <p>This post marks the beginning of a blog that I hope to update regularly. Of course, if I don&rsquo;t, then I will delete this blog after some time and this post will never have existed. Well, it may be archived on some server somewhere on the web, but then that is inevitable.</p>
