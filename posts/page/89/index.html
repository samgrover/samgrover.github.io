</section>

<section><p>I like reading, but unfortunately, I don't get much time to read for pleasure these days. Adding to that sorry state of affairs is the fact that I'm a slow reader. When I do read nowadays, it is more of <a href="https://samgrover.wordpress.com/tag/non-fiction/" title="My blog entries about non-fiction books">non-fiction</a>. On those rare occasions that I do read fiction, I love a good short story.</p>
<p>Apart from being concise, short stories stay focused and leave a lot to the imagination. They appeal to the minimalist in me. They build around a key idea or theme and my favorite kind have a twist or climax at the very end. An extreme and wonderful example is Ernest Hemmingway's six word story: &quot;For sale: Baby shoes. Never used&quot;.</p>
<p>Here are some short stories that I came across on the internet in recent times. I think they are marvelous and recommend them to you, my imaginary readers. One for each of you three :-D</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lucis.net/stuff/clarke/9billion_clarke.html" title="The Nine Billion Names of God">The Nine Billion Names of God</a> by Arthur C. Clarke</li>
<li><a href="https://web.mit.edu/jona/www/lq1.html" title="The Last Question">The Last Question</a> by Isaac Asimov</li>
<li><a href="https://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/hb.html" title="Harrison Bergeron">Harrison Bergeron</a> by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.</li>
</ul>
If you have a short story recommendation, leave a comment! :-)

<section><p align="left">![](https://static.flickr.com/50/144411688_eae14d6f43_m.jpg)Meet Liz. She likes to travel. When she isn&#039;t traveling, she might be in Portland or Nepal. Right now she is in Asia where she is on assignment from <a href="https://villagefocus.org/" title="Village Focus International">Village Focus International</a>. Through her words and photography she will bring to us a taste of the life in Cambodia as she documents the grassroots development efforts of village folk. She will put nuggets of it on her <a href="https://www.villagefocusinthefield.blogspot.com/" title="Village Focus - In The Field">professional blog</a>.</p>
Her personal blog is <a href="https://galactictraveler.blogspot.com/" title="Galactic Traveler">Galactic Traveler</a>. There you can read her story and experiences over the years. Many of the posts tell interesting stories about her time in Afghanistan working for the UN for the last two years. See the one about the <a href="https://galactictraveler.blogspot.com/2005/07/here-in-middle-earth.html" title="Here in ">changes in Afghan society</a>, the one about the <a href="https://galactictraveler.blogspot.com/2005/11/bombing.html" title="The Bombing">bombing outside her office</a>, or the one about <a href="https://galactictraveler.blogspot.com/2005/11/kabul-feels-like.html" title="Kabul Feels Like ...">Kabul</a>, which has a really cool photo.
<p>She has a wonderful spirit of adventure and discovery, coupled with courage, resolve and that elusive human quality that makes instant friends of strangers. As one of those erstwhile strangers, I wish her the very best in her endeavours.</p>

<section><p>I got a promotional email from <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" title="Netflix">Netflix</a> today. They would like me to forward an offer of a free month of service to my friends and family. A few months ago I would have sent it out to some people, but Netflix's service has gotten progressively worse in recent times. I'll continue to be a subscriber for a while to see how it goes, but there is no way that I'm recommending it to others at this time.</p>

<section><p align="left">![](https://static.flickr.com/54/129896711_ddb39aa3f0_t.jpg)Wear them horizontally as shown in the picture. The bass sounds much better. They are more prone to slip out when used that way, but if you're not moving too much (just sitting, walking) they will be alright. I've been using them like that for months. It has come up in conversations a couple of times so I thought I'd blog it and share. Maybe it's already well known.</p>

<section><p align="left">![](https://static.flickr.com/47/110609873_a3fb9544ab_m.jpg)The other day, at the eleventh hour, I learnt that a nearby theater will be playing Stanley Kubrick's [A Clockwork Orange](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/). It is based on Anthony Burgess' book of the same name. It is one of my favorite movies and I had never seen it in a theater. So, off I went for a dose of the ultraviolence.</p>
<p align="left">The theater manager informed us that it was the largest turnout in their current series of classic films. The print was an original one, scratches and all. There was even a bit of trouble with it towards the end, which caused a pause in the show. That brought on comments, the likes of which are only heard when the audience comprises fans of a cult classic.</p>
<p align="left">There are many cool things about this movie. The dialogues are peppered with [Nadsat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadsat), which Burgess invented. Some things made sense only on repeat viewing. That is probably one of the hallmarks of a cult movie, I guess. The movie is beautiful to look at, with lovely locations and colorful costumes. The performances are superb. But the best part, in my opinion, is the music. Beethoven's 9th Symphony forms a part of the story and is partially heard in Wendy Carlos' electronic rendition.</p>
<p align="left">See it. Again.</p>

</section>

<section><p>I don&rsquo;t have a radio. On many occasions I&rsquo;ve heard people say good things about NPR and so recently I&rsquo;ve been listening to some of the podcasts offered by them. They are excellent programs and I thought I&rsquo;d recommend a couple to anyone interested in listening in.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/asc/">All Songs Considered</a>. It is hosted by Bob Boilen (sometimes in conversation with guests) and features newly available music from various artists. The selection is eclectic and I&rsquo;ve found some great new artists from listening to the show.</p>
<p>The second is <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/">Science Friday</a>. It is hosted by Ira Flatow. He discusses various current issues in science with guests who are prominent members of the scientific community. The conversations are interesting and introduce me to a larger scientific domain than what I&rsquo;m used to hearing about in the computer science area.</p>
<p>They are both weekly shows, so it&rsquo;s not that hard to keep up. Check them out!</p>

My cousin sent me some scans of old photos. She is the little one in the pictures. These are from 1986/7 and were taken at our house in New Delhi. We all used to live as a joint family, ten to fifteen people spanning three generations in one house. Anyway, the photos brought back memories and I wrote about each one of them on flickr. See the [photoset](https://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72057594048405929/).

</section>

<section><p align="left">![](https://static.flickr.com/40/79584717_a05bafb4ba_t.jpg)"<a title="The Search" href="https://battellemedia.com/thesearch/">The Search</a>" by John Battelle is about the impact that search technology is having and will have on our culture. "Search" is defined quite broadly and includes the coming realm of ubiquitous computing. Google is a major focus of the book, and its influence and growth surely warrant that focus.</p>
<p align="left">What motivated me to read this book was the concept of the "[Database of Intentions](https://battellemedia.com/archives/000063.php)". It refers to the ability of an ubiquitous search technology to extract the intention of one or more of its users by analyzing their interactions with a plethora of devices. That is absolutely fascinating and will be quite something when it is realized. Needless to say, it will be the Oracle of the information age. It is an update on the idea of the Memex described by Vannevar Bush in "<a title="As We May Think" href="https://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/pub/vbush/vbush.shtml">As We May Think</a>", which is cited in the book. A meta-Memex.</p>
<p align="left">A good portion of the book, however, is devoted to the history of search technology and industry. That is quite interesting in and of itself as I like to read about such things. There are several anecdotes about the people and companies that played a part in these nascent times. I found it to be too detailed in some places, but the book is written such that one could easily skip those parts if one finds them too dull. I didn't.</p>
<p align="left">The epilogue highlights that we remember people from history because they became immortal through records. In the future, everyone will be immortal because everything will be recorded. This blog is being recorded. All of it will add to the noise and one will have to shout or be referenced a lot to be seen clearly. Will you shout? What will you say? I think you should write a book while they are still in vogue ;-)</p>
