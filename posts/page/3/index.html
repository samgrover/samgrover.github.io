    >A new version of Mimi Uploader is out with even more support for Photo Collections üéâ</a
  ><p>The previous release had the ability to see your list of collections. This new one adds the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add photos to collections from the list of recent uploads. Tap and hold a single photo, or use the &ldquo;‚Ä¶&rdquo; menu on en entry that has a batch of photos to add them all.</li>
<li>Delete a photo from a collection. When browsing a collection, tap and hold on a photo to see the option to delete.</li>
<li>Create a collection. Just tap &ldquo;+&rdquo; on the collections list.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding this way of managing my collections to be great. Hope you like it too!</p></section>

  ><p>I enjoy podcasts but I got the feeling I was listening to a lot of tech. In 2024, I reduced the time to about 50%. In 2023 they were close to 65%.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2025/1d388405-4898-4f0c-8f7d-5c5df630596e.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2025/1d388405-4898-4f0c-8f7d-5c5df630596e.jpg" alt="The image shows a 2024 summary of top nine podcasts listened to in Overcast, with a total of 288 hours spent, 156 of which were in tech podcasts."></a></p>
<p>Maybe I can get it down to 40% this year.</p></section>

    >üõ†Ô∏è Basement Storage Shelves</a
  ><p>Over the last week or so I designed and built freestanding storage shelves in our basement. Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8w7XGiVMbs">this video</a>, and other similar ones, I decided that I would give it a go.</p>
<p>The basement had become a mess of stuff, about 70% of which was worth keeping. So we started by re-organizing what we wanted to keep and the rest we discarded/donated/gave-away.</p>
<p>On the 23rd I drew up the plan, and we went and bought the first set of materials from a <a href="https://52ndhardware.com">neighborhood building material store</a>, which has amazing people. Then came the holiday, so I didn&rsquo;t start to build until the 26th.</p></section>

    >Back to Reading</a
  ><p>I enjoy reading but realized that this activity had reduced in my life. So this year I made a concerted effort to read more, and it worked. I&rsquo;ve found that the key to my enjoyment of reading is to read a variety. So I mix books that are short, long, fiction, non-fiction, old, new, most-often read genres and others.</p>
<p>On average I&rsquo;m reading smaller books than before, but I&rsquo;m reading a whole lot more of them, as seen in these charts.</p></section>
