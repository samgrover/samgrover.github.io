<p>Last weekend we went hiking at <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Coyote_Wall_Hike">Coyote Wall</a>. Jenni and I had never been to this hike before but our friends were familiar with it.</p>
<p>There are multiple trails that meet each other at various points. Some are gentle slopes, while others are steeper. One can pick and choose paths based on how much of a workout one wants and switch that around as needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54552038476_52c6e66786_h.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are beautiful vistas all along the way to the top of the wall. I could see myself bringing family and friends here that are not used to hiking much, to just go for a bit, enjoy the views, and head back.</p>

<p>There are cute little waterfalls and streams as well along the way.</p>

<p>On the way down we took the steeper route for a bit. Some folks were mountain biking along the cliff and down the steep trails, which was incredible to watch but not something I see myself doing 😅</p>

<p>I can see myself coming back to this hike again in the spring, and probably in other seasons as well.</p>

</section>

<section><p>I&rsquo;ve been journaling in <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> for some time now. I like it for a lot of reasons, and it&rsquo;s working out great. So far I&rsquo;ve been using it as a plain old journal, where you write what&rsquo;s on your mind. Recently, I decided that I wanted to get my digital history into it as well. One of the first things that came to mind was my <a href="https://foursquare.com">Foursquare/Swarm</a> checkin history which goes back to 2009. I decided to start there.</p>
<p>I exported all my data and wrote a script in Python to extract what I needed from it to make journal entries. The two relevant files were <code>checkins.json</code> and <code>photos.json</code>. You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/samgrover/26939e0b68a26b7fe03a7a4bd37bdcf6">get my script on Github by selecting here</a> if you&rsquo;d like to use it, or dig into it. It should also appear embedded at the end of this post. First the script pre-processes the data to get all the photos attached to checkins. Then it goes over the checkin history to extract most of what I want, but since the exported data doesn&rsquo;t include venue coordinates, it has to do a little more.</p>
<p>It makes calls to the <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs">Foursquare API</a> to fetch the venue coordinates for each checkin. Then it puts everything together and makes the actual entry using Day One&rsquo;s <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/support/CLI">command line utility</a>. I had several thousand entries but the free plan for the API has a daily limit of 500 calls, so I manually ran it a few times over the course of a couple of weeks until they&rsquo;d all been imported. I could&rsquo;ve automated that but I wasn&rsquo;t keen on spending the time on that.</p>
<p>Day One does allow one to link it to <a href="https://help.dayoneapp.com/tips-and-tutorials/using-ifttt-with-day-one">IFTTT</a> so that all <em>new</em> checkins get logged automatically, and I enabled that a while back, but I&rsquo;ve not been happy with that integration. Now that I&rsquo;m familiar with the flow of data, I plan to create new entries every couple of months or so, perhaps with a new script that works entirely with the API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear if you have automated any journaling as I&rsquo;m keen to explore other ways of doing so myself.</p>

<section class="relative my-10 first-of-type:mt-0 last-of-type:mb-0"><h2 class="my-0!">Initial experience with Setapp</h2>

  <a class="absolute inset-0 text-[0px]" href="https://samgrover.com/2019/04/14/initial-experience-with.html"
    >Initial experience with Setapp</a
  >
</section>

<section><p>I signed up for <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8">Setapp</a> for a free trial week. Setapp is an app subscription service for macOS where you sign up for $10 a month to gain full access to a catalog of over 100 apps.</p>
<p>This is not a review of Setapp, but rather my initial experience with it after having heard about it a few times on the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/">Mac Power Users</a> podcast. Many of apps in the Setapp catalog are well known and as such I was already aware of them. But there are several that are new to me.</p>
<p>Apps that I found myself using often during the trial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marked</li>
<li>Mindnode</li>
<li>Flume</li>
<li>Timing</li>
<li>iStat Menus</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps I installed and use occasionally and would expect to use occasionally in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi Explorer</li>
<li>World Clock Pro</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps I tried but then uninstalled after using just one or two times:</p>
<ul>
<li>CleanMyMac X</li>
<li>IconJar</li>
<li>Luminar Flex</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps that are included in Setapp but which I&rsquo;ve previously bought individually and use anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screens</li>
<li>Paw</li>
<li>Sip</li>
</ul>
<p>So with a very rough mental calculation I think the math would work out alright. Of course the main hook/promise of Setapp is the <em>potential</em> of all the other apps. Many may not be relevant today but may become relevant tomorrow. Their <a href="https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000890969-Setapp-applications">stated goal</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have 100+ apps in the stack and are steadily adding more of them to cover all of your main needs. Eventually, Setapp is to deliver about 300 Mac apps, all per a single $9.99 fee (+ taxes).</p></blockquote>
<p>I have already identified some apps that I plan to use soon but just didn&rsquo;t have a chance to use during the trial period. I&rsquo;ve now subscribed for one month, and if it still seems useful after that, I will likely switch to the annual plan for 10% off.</p>
<p>If you would like to try out Setapp, <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8">select here to use my referral code</a>.</p>
