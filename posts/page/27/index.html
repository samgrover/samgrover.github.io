    >An App for Mapping My Outdoor Activities With Apple Watch Using GPX Tracks</a
  >
</section>

<section><p>I use an Apple Watch to track my activities, whether that be workouts or recreational. For outdoor activities, the watch records location data throughout the activity. This is later shown on a map in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitness/id1208224953">Fitness app</a> on the iPhone. While that map is interactive, exporting it only exports a low resolution image, and not the actual route.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/cc30649b50.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/cc30649b50.jpg" alt="A walking track is overlaid on a map."></a></p>
<p>When I share an activity on a blog post I like to show the map but I don&rsquo;t like the idea of just sharing an image of the map. I would like to get the actual data out so that it can be overlaid on an interactive map using various mapping tools.</p>
<p>I found an app on the App Store that can export the data, among many other features, but I wasn&rsquo;t keen on paying a subscription for this one small occasional use case. As an app developer, I know that access to this data is controlled by the Health related privacy settings on the iPhone and is accessible using the HealthKit framework. So I decided make a small app to get this data out while also gaining familiarity with that part of the iOS SDK. A few weeks ago I got started on it. I worked on it in small chunks of time, as I usually do with such side projects. The UI came together pretty quickly as a SwiftUI app. It is nothing special but looks presentable and gets the job done.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/622da65a84.png"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/622da65a84.png" alt="Screenshot of an app showing a list of workouts with options to fetch and share the route from some of them."></a></p>
<p>It took just a little bit longer to get the data out from HealthKit. Converting it to GPX files was straightforward. Once I had created a file I could use the share sheet to get it into other apps or to simply save it. From there it can be imported into tools that <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Track_drawing_websites">put it on a map</a>.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://gist.github.com/samgrover/0d81059365aaaca3183267436fa988bb">GPX file</a> of a walk at <a href="https://www.travelportland.com/attractions/mount-tabor-park/">Mount Tabor Park</a>. It can be utilized to create an embedded map as shown below.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="//umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/walking-at-mt-tabor_882915?scaleControl=false&miniMap=false&scrollWheelZoom=false&zoomControl=true&allowEdit=false&moreControl=true&searchControl=null&tilelayersControl=null&embedControl=null&datalayersControl=true&onLoadPanel=undefined&captionBar=false"></iframe><p><a href="//umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/walking-at-mt-tabor_882915" target="_blank">See full screen</a></p>
<p>Or even into <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1ktetwF5600NqxWJ1cub7ODZfLVvW6jk&amp;usp=sharing">Google Maps</a>. In fact once imported there, you can view the track with elevation by selecting the option for Google Earth and enabling the 3D view. I love this option as it adds another dimension (literally 😂) to the activity.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/45ecc99609.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/45ecc99609.jpg" alt="Screenshot of track on 3D view from Google Earth."></a></p>
<p>Both these presentation styles are far more interesting to me than just a low resolution image out of the Fitness app.</p>

<section><p>I was thinking about getting more of those AcuRite sensors for expanding my <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/03/01/home-climate-monitoring.html">home climate monitoring</a> when I realized that I already have a couple of devices recording this and other data.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/346875b7ca.png"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/346875b7ca.png" alt="Screenshot showing charts of temperature, humidity, and air quality time series."></a></p>
<p>These include my <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZnOfFX">Ecobee Thermostat and Remote Sensor</a> and my <a href="https://amzn.to/41MeiIK">IQAir AirVisual Pro</a>. Both of these have means of getting the data off of them using an API. This <a href="https://den.dev/blog/air/">blog post</a> by Den Delimarsky really helped with the IQAir API. <a href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/developers/">Ecobee API</a> was straightforward. And after some coding and testing, I had a couple of scripts running that could pull metrics from them and send them to <code>influxdb</code>. So now I have a few more data points for existing metrics, and have added air quality to it.</p>
<p>In the previous blog post , I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to take a break from any further optimizing/tweaking for now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that didn&rsquo;t happen! But maybe now 🤔</p>
<p>P.S. The screenshot above illustrates a few other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>How I got the scripts going in starts and stops as I figured out the issues in having them always running.</li>
<li>A macOS update that I started before heading out for a few hours, which led to a large gap because I still have all of this on my desktop Mac.</li>
<li>The dots show how some data was reduced in granularity overnight because of device settings that put it to sleep. So I changed those settings the next day.</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section><p>Sometime last year my friend Andrew made me aware of the sensors and software he was using to monitor temperature and humidity in his home. I thought that was cool and it introduced me to several hardware and software tools that I had not known about. I wanted to set this up at my home so I filed a project for a later date.</p>
<p>Well, that day arrived a few weeks ago and here&rsquo;s what it looks like today:</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/7387c64251.png"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/7387c64251.png" alt="Screenshot showing charts of temperature and humidity time series."></a></p>
<p>To get started exploring this I purchased an <a href="https://amzn.to/3ky05hO">AcuRite bundle</a> of three sensor towers and one display. I set up the towers around my home and put the display in my home office. It was neat to see the display showing the measurements at any given time. Soon I wanted to go to the next level and record and see the data over time.</p>
<p>These sensors broadcast the data over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPD433">433 MHz</a> and there are consumer level antennas and software available to read this data. I bought a <a href="https://amzn.to/3Y6Ew5x">NooElec bundle</a> which gave me all the hardware I needed to receive this data on my computer. Setting it up was straightforward. I used <a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433">rtl_433</a> and was able to start seeing the wireless data immediately in the terminal on my Mac.</p>
<p>The next step was storing all this data. That&rsquo;s where <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb">influxdb</a> came in. And the glue to get it from <code>rtl_433</code> to <code>influxdb</code> involved <a href="https://mqtt.org">MQTT</a> and <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf">telegraf</a>.</p>
<p>There was a lot of trial and error but I finally got it all set up and was able to get the data into <code>influxdb</code>. I even made a dashboard in there to visualize it. The options on that dashboard were limited so I got <a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana">grafana</a> set up and built a dashboard in that which can be seen at the top of this post as seen on my desktop browser. It also looks great on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Except for <code>rtl_433</code>, the rest of the tools all run on docker on my desktop Mac. At some point I may migrate that off to a Raspberry Pi but for now it&rsquo;s all working and I&rsquo;m going to take a break from any further optimizing/tweaking for now.</p>
<p><strong>Update (6th March, 2023):</strong> <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/03/06/adding-api-accessible.html">Follow up post</a> about expanding on this effort.</p>

<section><p>📽️ Over the weekend we saw the <a href="https://shorts.tv/theoscarshorts/">2023 Oscar Animated Shorts</a> at a local theater. That was the first time I had gone to see something like that and it was quite enjoyable. Most of the films are a delight. The theater had cozy seats and serves brunch so that made it a little extra fun.</p>
