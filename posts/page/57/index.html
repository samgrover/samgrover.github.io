  ><p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/1ac115c357.jpg" alt="Ashish. Seattle. 2014."></p>
<p>Ashish Grover, or Ashu, as we called him endearingly passed away on Monday, 6th July, 2020 in New York City. His passing was sudden and unexpected. It has shaken up our entire family across two vast countries. He was only 48. Now he will forever be 48.</p>
<p>Technically he was my cousin, but we grew up under the same roof in New Delhi, our mothers cooked side by side in the same kitchen, we ate at the same table. I shared his room for a while in the 80s, as our growing joint family was on the verge of becoming a nuclear one. He was my brother.</p></section>

We try and go each year around this time when the roses are in full bloom. It never disappoints, even with an overcast sky. Of course it was a little different this year, as with everything else.</p>

  ><p>A couple of days ago I finished reading <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780441478125?aff=samgrover">The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin</a>. It was published fifty-one years ago, but feels like it could&rsquo;ve been this year. A wonderful and timeless story written with immaculate detail, and emotional depth. There were many sentences all over the book that I read more than once because they were worth savoring.</p>
<p>I first heard of Ursula K. Le Guin a long time ago. At the time I thought of her as a Fantasy author, and I used to think of myself as someone that enjoys reading Sci-Fi, but not Fantasy. It was an arbitrary distinction that I hope is behind me. But as a result I didn&rsquo;t introduce myself to her work even though she was frequently mentioned in the context of Sci-Fi. I hope to read more of her works in the future.</p></section>

<p>First was an Instagram story where all you had to do was swipe up and that opened a webpage which then brought up an email composer filled out with an email and with email addresses populated. You just had to update placeholders with your info and hit send.</p>
<p>Second is this bot that requests people to update their black square photos on Instagram so that they don&rsquo;t drown out actual black voices using the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag: <a href="https://github.com/char/blm-instagram-bot">github.com/char/blm-&hellip;</a></p></section>

    >Magic Trackpad 2 or: How I Started to Prefer Gestures and Taps to Gripping and Clicking</a
  ><p>About three months ago I heard of someone using a trackpad with their non-dominant hand at their Mac. Now I&rsquo;d heard of such a use before but this time I had a trackpad lying around. I&rsquo;d gotten it with my Mac instead of a mouse because I already had a mouse, but had stashed it away. So I got it out and set it up for my left hand.</p>
<p>A month passed. I was using it rarely. One day the battery in my mouse ran out in the middle of the workday, so I plugged it in and moved the trackpad over to the right side.</p></section>
