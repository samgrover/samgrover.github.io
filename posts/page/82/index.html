  ><p>Mike Johnston, over at <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/">T.O.P</a>, writes interesting posts quite often. He has recently written a couple of them that hit close to home. They are <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/05/a-leica-year.html">The Leica as Teacher</a> and <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/05/why-it-has-to-be-a-leica.html">Why It Has To Be a Leica</a>. Mike suggests a training program using the Leica for a year to shoot <abbr title="Black and White">B&amp;W</abbr> film extensively and to edit and critique oneself on the photos taken. I&rsquo;ve tried to do exactly that over the last two years.</p></section>

    >I&#39;m doing other stuff too</a
  ><p>Yea, the last few posts on this blog have all been about Avatari. Life, as usual, is way more varied. Here&rsquo;s a recap of some travels and photos from the last few months.</p>
<p>Late last year, Liz and I traveled to Asia. We visited her Nepalese home near Kathmandu, had our second wedding of the year in New Delhi and then went to Bali for our honeymoon. That&rsquo;s a whole &rsquo;nother blog post that one of us will eventually write on <a href="http://samandliz.wordpress.com/">our blog</a>. Oh, but the pictures are ready to go in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/collections/72157618568809607/">Asia 2008 collection</a> on Flickr.</p></section>

  ><div style="text-align:center;">![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3311/3454418766_249edbc108.jpg)</div>
<p>You wanted AddressBook and iChat support. It is here!</p>
<p>I wanted more web services to adopt an API for uploading avatars. <a href="http://shizzow.com/">Shizzow</a> responded with enthusiasm. That support is here too!</p>
<p>By enabling AddressBook and/or iChat support, entries appear in the account list for each of those. When you are ready to update your avatar, just select them if you want to update those too.</p>
<p>If you use iChat for Google Talk, then setting your avatar in iChat will update your avatar on Google&rsquo;s servers the next time you connect or immediately if you are already connected. Google then updates your avatar across all their services including Gmail, Google Profile, etc.</p></section>

Avatari is an application to update your avatars across the Internet with one click.
<p>I keep my avatar the same most of the time but every now and then I would replace it for a short period to represent a holiday or a cause or some event. When I would do that it would annoy me that I had to go to each individual location where I had uploaded my avatar for a brief replacement.</p></section>

It has been a little over eight months since I [bought the Wii](http://blog.samgrover.com/2008/03/16/time-to-play-again/). Even though my best video game experiences have been on a PC, the Wii holds its own and is a pleasure to play.
<p>I started with the wonderful Super Mario Galaxy and it was the only Wii game I played until a couple of months ago. Then, for five days each, I rented Transformers, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, one after another. And although I didn&rsquo;t really get in to Brawl, I thoroughly enjoyed the other two.</p></section>

<div>Congratulations!</div>
<div><p>Hope you are well. What an awesome night. Liz and I are elated and the mood in Portland is ecstatic, as it is in several parts of the US and the globe. Everyone I know is happy. With the state of things, there are probably tough times ahead but this makes it so much better. In whatever way you may have contributed to this day, I thank you.</p></section>

    >Thirty-two</a
  ><p>I&rsquo;ve never blogged about my birthday before, which is strange because I&rsquo;ve had thirty-one of them. A few seconds ago I turned thirty-two.</p>
<p>Here are some personally memorable events since my last birthday:</p>
<ul>
	<li>October - Made a trip to India for dad's 60th birthday celebration.</li>
	<li>January - Got all four of my wisdom teeth extracted. Two had to be dug out. Was on a soup diet for a couple of weeks.</li>
	<li>February - Created the first version of the [LazyEngine](http://lazyengine.appspot.com/).</li>
	<li>March - Asked Liz to marry me. She said yes. Bought a Wii. The engagement was decidedly more memorable, but the Wii has been fun too :-)</li>
	<li>April - Attended a concert by Zakir Hussain and met him.</li>
	<li>May - Went to the hot springs at Brietenbush. Sis and niece came over to visit. We all had a great time.</li>
	<li>June - Moved to a new place right next to the river in NW Portland. Liz spoke at Ignite Portland 3.</li>
	<li>July - Liz and I made a [trip to Maine](http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/our-trip-to-maine/) to visit her parents and to spend the 4th of July holiday with them. Later that month, I traveled to Porto, Portugal to attend a conference. Lovely little city. It was my first time in Europe.</li>
	<li>August - Liz and I had our [Portland wedding](http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/we-got-married/). Our New Delhi wedding is in December. We went to Crater Lake for a weekend. Beautiful place. Our first time there. I traveled to San Francisco to showcase my work.</li>
	<li>September - I hacked together [ff2tweet](http://github.com/samgrover/ff2tweet/tree/master). Hope to refine it further in the future.</li>
</ul>
It was a wonderful year and I'm looking forward to the next one.
<p>And lastly, here&rsquo;s more about the number <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32_(number)">32</a>.</p></section>

    >ff2tweet</a
  ><p>I got sick of reposting to Twitter what I had just posted to FriendFeed. I was doing that to enable conversations in both networks. I tried twitterfeed and Yahoo! Pipes, before deciding to just write a tool to do exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>ff2tweet is a tool to convert a FriendFeed post into a tweet and post it to Twitter. It does so while ensuring that the tweet is within the character limit and incorporates any comment made by the user when posting on FriendFeed. It also inspects the link in the post to shorten and add to the tweet as necessary.</p></section><nav class="mt-14 flex"><a class="btn not-prose" href="/posts/page/81/"
