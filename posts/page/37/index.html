<section><p>A little over a year ago Jenni and I made this wall mounted cookware hanging rack.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/29b5bd2792.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/29b5bd2792.jpg" alt="Boards mounted on a wall horizontally, with hardware mounted to the boards and pans and decorative items hanging off the hardware."></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been wanting a place to put our pans for a while It&rsquo;s tedious to manage them in a drawer or cabinet, if you can even fit them in there. Often some would just stay on the stove and need to be moved out of the way when cooking. Whenever I would see pans hanging, in person or in a photo, it seemed like the best solution. We had space on only one wall in the kitchen, so that decision was easy.</p>
<p>Pans can be heavy and our walls are lathe and plaster, so mounting just about anywhere was out of the question. And so the construction method was narrowed down to boards mounted to studs, with hardware to hang the pans.</p>
<p>We went to the <a href="https://www.woodcrafters.us">amazing local woodworking store</a> where they have finished dimensional lumber and narrowed down our choice based primarily on cost. We wanted a dark color, and I already had dark walnut stain from the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2019/05/25/mail-and-keys.html">mail and keys organizer</a> I made a while back.</p>
<p>Back home, I cut the boards to length. We wanted a tight fit and the two ends, door frame and wall, weren&rsquo;t super plumb so there were a lot of measurements and dry fitting before we had a set of boards that were just right. It was time to apply the stain and let it rest.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/5efd3a72bb.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/5efd3a72bb.jpg" alt="A triptych of ca can of dark walnut stain, lumber stacked in a store showing a price of $4.29 per linear foot, and Jenni applying the stain to the boards while wearing a respirator."></a></p>
<p>After that it was a straightforward process of screwing in the boards to the studs while using a couple of small blocks to space them evenly.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/04343ec9ad.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/04343ec9ad.jpg" alt="A triptych showing progression of boards being arranged and mounted on to the wall, and with hardware attached."></a></p>
<p>Once that was done, we installed a couple of IKEA rails that we had and the rack was ready to use. In the days that followed we sourced some nice hooks and Jenni put up a couple of planters and some homegrown produce.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/84b2a87972.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/84b2a87972.jpg" alt="A diptych showing details of various things hanging off the rack, a planter, dry red chillis, a bunch of garlic pigtailed together and a small plant watering can."></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been over a year and this has totally been worth it. I highly recommend utilizing vertical space in the kitchen where you can.</p>
<p>P.S. This blog post should&rsquo;ve been written about a year ago. Anyway, it&rsquo;s been written now.</p>

<p>As I was taking these photos I was thinking how I prefer the 2x for compositions when it comes to zoom. 3x is handy but I have so many years of composing in ~50mm (2x on iPhone). Alas, iPhone 13 Pro can only do 2x with a crop on 1x image. Here I thought the tradeoff was worth it.</p>

  >
</section>

<section><p>Recent Uploads currently shows the uploads you make from Mimi Uploader. After the next update it will also show uploads made to your Micro.blog account from anywhere else 🎉</p>
<p>Mimi is primarily a batch uploader and that is my favorite way of using it. I like to make blog posts that have a set of photos, and making that process smoother was the motivation to create Mimi in the first place. As such, each batch of photos shows up in Recent Uploads as a set.</p>
<p>The other uploads to a Micro.blog account are only accessible as individual images. So the UI challenge before me was how to show these other types of recent uploads. At first I started to make a new screen that listed all the uploads on an account but that wasn&rsquo;t working, primary reason being that it was boring af. After mulling it over I came up with an interface that feels better as a part of Mimi, and that&rsquo;s illustrated in the video below:</p>
<p><video controls="controls" playsinline="playsinline" src="https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/com-samgrover-dropshare/recent-uploads-may-2022.mp4" poster="https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/com-samgrover-dropshare/recent-uploads-may-2022-poster.jpg" preload="none" width="583" height="1266" alt="Recent Uploads screen showing the behavior of the new feature."></video></p>
<p>All uploads on the account show up inline with the sets of Mimi uploads in the same reverse chronological list that is in the current version. There are subtle UI differences between the two types in the list, e.g. the background color for each kind of post is different. On the top right is a filter button that lets you filter for one type or another, if you choose to do so.</p>
<p>Exporting still works the same way with a right swipe. Sets of uploads made from Mimi can still be deleted with a left swipe. As always this only deletes the batch from Mimi and doesn&rsquo;t affect the uploaded images. Other uploads don&rsquo;t offer the deletion because they are representing the images on Micro.blog and not an uploaded set. This <em>may</em> cause confusion but I currently don&rsquo;t have a design to avoid that. Got ideas?</p>
<p>I should have a beta out by this weekend so you can try this feature out if you like. To get on the beta, <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/AbjtGWge">sign up for it with TestFlight</a>.</p>
