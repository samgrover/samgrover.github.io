<section><div style="text-align:center;">![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3311/3454418766_249edbc108.jpg)</div>
<p>You wanted AddressBook and iChat support. It is here!</p>
<p>I wanted more web services to adopt an API for uploading avatars. <a href="https://shizzow.com/">Shizzow</a> responded with enthusiasm. That support is here too!</p>
<p>By enabling AddressBook and/or iChat support, entries appear in the account list for each of those. When you are ready to update your avatar, just select them if you want to update those too.</p>
<p>If you use iChat for Google Talk, then setting your avatar in iChat will update your avatar on Google&rsquo;s servers the next time you connect or immediately if you are already connected. Google then updates your avatar across all their services including Gmail, Google Profile, etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just updated Avatari to the latest version using the newly added auto-update feature. This has been made super simple through the <a href="https://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/">Sparkle</a> framework for Cocoa. After you download this version, the application should auto-update with each new release. There is also a &ldquo;Check for updates&hellip;&rdquo; feature in the application menu for manual checks.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/bsneed">@bsneed</a> for the idea to support AddressBook and iChat and to <a href="https://twitter.com/ryansnyder">@ryansnyder</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/shizzow">@shizzow</a> for responding to my call for an API within a matter of days!</p>
<p>Heartfelt thanks to all of you for the enthusiastic response to my first Cocoa application! I hope you like this release and continue to provide me with your feedback on my Gmail address, samgrover. I will do my best to deliver.</p>

<p>Requires Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard). Runs on Intel and PowerPC based Mac computers. Supports multiple accounts on Twitter, FriendFeed, Shizzow and your Mac&rsquo;s AddressBook, iChat.</p>

Avatari is an application to update your avatars across the Internet with one click.
<p>I keep my avatar the same most of the time but every now and then I would replace it for a short period to represent a holiday or a cause or some event. When I would do that it would annoy me that I had to go to each individual location where I had uploaded my avatar for a brief replacement.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>I made Avatari to solve this problem. It currently supports multiple accounts on <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a>. When I came up with this idea, I found that Twitter already had an API for uploading an avatar but FriendFeed didn&rsquo;t. I requested the folks at FriendFeed to create an API for me, and to my pleasant surprise, they had one ready in twenty days. Thanks guys! I hope to add more services in the future.</p>
<p>My other motivation for making Avatari is to teach myself Cocoa programming. I had hoped to make something useful while familiarizing myself with Cocoa. It&rsquo;s working great and I&rsquo;m hoping to advance my knowledge of Cocoa software development with continued effort.</p>
<p>Last week I presented Avatari to the folks at <a href="https://cocoaheads.org/us/PortlandOregon/index.html">Portland CocoaHeads</a> and tonight I presented it at <a href="https://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1908530/">Demolicious</a>. I&rsquo;d like to thank all the folks at either event for their feedback, ideas and encouragement regarding this project.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/uqbar/8122911/">Giglielmo</a> for sharing <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/uqbar/8122911/">the photo</a> used in the logo under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/deed.en">Attribution-Share Alike license</a> and to my wife, <a href="https://lizgrover.com/">Liz</a> for transforming it into the application logo.</p>
<p>I hope you like using Avatari. Let me know what I can do to make it better. You can reach me at my Gmail address, samgrover or via <a href="https://twitter.com/samgrover">@samgrover</a>. You can download Avatari from the <a href="https://samgrover.com/sw/">software section</a> on my website or by clicking the link below.</p>

It has been a little over eight months since I [bought the Wii](https://blog.samgrover.com/2008/03/16/time-to-play-again/). Even though my best video game experiences have been on a PC, the Wii holds its own and is a pleasure to play.
<p>I started with the wonderful Super Mario Galaxy and it was the only Wii game I played until a couple of months ago. Then, for five days each, I rented Transformers, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, one after another. And although I didn&rsquo;t really get in to Brawl, I thoroughly enjoyed the other two.</p>
<p>Then came October, and my awesome mother-in-law completely surprised me with two Wii games for my birthday. Pirates of the Carribean: At World&rsquo;s End and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Both are based on movies that I haven&rsquo;t seen. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed The Mummy more than Pirates.</p>
<p>Then came November, and keeping in mind that Liz and I will be off to Asia during Christmas, my mom-in-law sent our presents early. Guess what I got, among other things? Yea, that&rsquo;s right, two more Wii games! Iron Man and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Each based on a movie that I have seen multiple times. Awesome! I haven&rsquo;t played Fantastic Four yet, but Iron Man has been fun so far.</p>
<p>Next week Liz and I leave for a vacation to Asia, but when I&rsquo;m back in January, I&rsquo;ll sure have a bunch of Wii games to play :)</p>

<blockquote>Dear friends,
<div>Congratulations!</div>
<div><p>Hope you are well. What an awesome night. Liz and I are elated and the mood in Portland is ecstatic, as it is in several parts of the US and the globe. Everyone I know is happy. With the state of things, there are probably tough times ahead but this makes it so much better. In whatever way you may have contributed to this day, I thank you.</p></div>

<section><p>I&rsquo;ve never blogged about my birthday before, which is strange because I&rsquo;ve had thirty-one of them. A few seconds ago I turned thirty-two.</p>
<p>Here are some personally memorable events since my last birthday:</p>
<ul>
	<li>October - Made a trip to India for dad's 60th birthday celebration.</li>
	<li>January - Got all four of my wisdom teeth extracted. Two had to be dug out. Was on a soup diet for a couple of weeks.</li>
	<li>February - Created the first version of the [LazyEngine](https://lazyengine.appspot.com/).</li>
	<li>March - Asked Liz to marry me. She said yes. Bought a Wii. The engagement was decidedly more memorable, but the Wii has been fun too :-)</li>
	<li>April - Attended a concert by Zakir Hussain and met him.</li>
	<li>May - Went to the hot springs at Brietenbush. Sis and niece came over to visit. We all had a great time.</li>
	<li>June - Moved to a new place right next to the river in NW Portland. Liz spoke at Ignite Portland 3.</li>
	<li>July - Liz and I made a [trip to Maine](https://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/our-trip-to-maine/) to visit her parents and to spend the 4th of July holiday with them. Later that month, I traveled to Porto, Portugal to attend a conference. Lovely little city. It was my first time in Europe.</li>
	<li>August - Liz and I had our [Portland wedding](https://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/we-got-married/). Our New Delhi wedding is in December. We went to Crater Lake for a weekend. Beautiful place. Our first time there. I traveled to San Francisco to showcase my work.</li>
	<li>September - I hacked together [ff2tweet](https://github.com/samgrover/ff2tweet/tree/master). Hope to refine it further in the future.</li>
</ul>
It was a wonderful year and I'm looking forward to the next one.
<p>And lastly, here&rsquo;s more about the number <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32_(number)">32</a>.</p>

</section>

<section><p>I got sick of reposting to Twitter what I had just posted to FriendFeed. I was doing that to enable conversations in both networks. I tried twitterfeed and Yahoo! Pipes, before deciding to just write a tool to do exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>ff2tweet is a tool to convert a FriendFeed post into a tweet and post it to Twitter. It does so while ensuring that the tweet is within the character limit and incorporates any comment made by the user when posting on FriendFeed. It also inspects the link in the post to shorten and add to the tweet as necessary.</p>
<p>ff2tweet is written in Python and I run it as a cron job on a server. It uses the FriendFeed and Twitter APIs to accomplish its task. It does what I wanted to do but it is a quick hack and there is definitely room for improvement. All feedback appreciated. The code is <a href="https://github.com/samgrover/ff2tweet/tree">available on github</a>. Join in!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on FriendFeed at <a href="https://friendfeed.com/samgrover">https://friendfeed.com/samgrover</a> and on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/samgrover">https://twitter.com/samgrover</a>.</p>

</section>

<section><p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://blog.samgrover.com/2008/06/19/whats-going-on/">last post</a>, (over two months ago!) I went to Portugal for a trip towards the end of July. I was attending the <a href="https://secrypt.org/">SECRYPT</a> conference and presenting my paper there. All I knew about Porto, was what I read on Wikipedia and other places online. I was looking forward to a cute historic European city and that&rsquo;s exactly what I got.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/2705654507" title="View 'North of the Douro river' on Flickr.com">![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3215/2705654507_fb504dbc68_m.jpg)</a></p>
<p>I reached there on a Friday afternoon, quite jet-lagged. The hotel (Hotel Melia Gaia Porto) was in the area south of the Douro river called Vila Nova De Gaia. That evening I got food at a nearby place and explored about a mile around the hotel, partly in search of a wall adapter for my laptop power cord. Walking around Gaia reminded me of India, especially my maternal grandma&rsquo;s neighborhood in Delhi. The streets are narrow. The cars are small. Old rustic architecture is mixed with modern glassy facades.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/2706426294" title="View 'Streetscape' on Flickr.com">![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3126/2706426294_ac1ae192e7_m.jpg)</a></p>
<p>The conference was at the hotel and ran from Saturday thru Tuesday. Each day, I would attend sessions until about 6pm and then head out to explore the city. On Saturday I took a leisurely photowalk towards the city center. As I got closer to the river, historic buildings appeared and this time I was reminded of Bombay, which has a heavy Portugese influence. The extent of that influence was more than I realized. I rediscovered words that I thought were of Indian origin, only to find that they were in fact Portugese. In Bombay, the word for bread is &lsquo;pao&rsquo; and the word for potato is &lsquo;batata&rsquo;. Both of those are Portugese words. This discovery surprised my friends and family too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/2726032241" title="View 'Angles' on Flickr.com">![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3226/2726032241_fcd088a46c_m.jpg)</a></p>
<p>Over the next few days I explored several areas around the Porto city center. The metro was very convenient. On my last day there I went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_da_M%C3%BAsica">Casa da Música</a>. It is an interesting building with non-perpendicular corners and a variety of unique rooms. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was completely open to the public for free. You could just walk into and all around its various rooms, even into the main auditorium. You could sit at a Steinway grand piano and play to your heart&rsquo;s content and no one would bother. I didn&rsquo;t because I don&rsquo;t know how but a guy was doing just that.</p>
<p>Overall the trip was productive and pleasant, definitely whetting my appetite to explore more of Europe. My photos from the trip are in the slideshow below. You can follow it to the photos on flickr where you can view their location on a map.</p>

<p>My sister and her daughter came by to visit me from India last month. They were here for about a week and we all had a great time going around the Portland metro area and nearby to the gorge and coast. Here they are at Cannon Beach.</p>

Around the end of May, my landlord and I had a disagreement on the terms for a lease renewal at my current place. So, I decided to move out and started looking for a new place. I found a nice two bedroom condo [right by the river](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=620+NW+Naito+Pkwy,+Portland+OR+97209&amp;mrt=all&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=45.528178,-122.672825&amp;spn=0.009275,0.017252&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr) in NW Portland and will be moving there this weekend.
<p>I got a paper accepted to a conference called <a href="https://secrypt.org/">SECRYPT</a>. I will be going to present it at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto">Porto, Portugal</a> during the last few days of July. I just applied for a Visa and am looking forward to my first trip to Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.igniteportland.com/">Ignite Portland</a> 3 happened last night. This time Liz was a speaker. She spoke about her experiences of traveling to Afghanistan. She has a ton of stories and did an excellent job of squeezing a five minute rapid fire inspirational talk from them. There was a good variety of topics, just like at the last Ignite Portland, which made the evening quite entertaining. This time we went to the after party at <a href="https://www.takeitin.com/">Imbibe</a> and had a great time with friends, old and new. You can see her slides and video right here. They go quite well together.</p>

<p>And lastly for now, Liz and I decided to start a blog together to document our adventures. I kicked it off tonight with a basic theme and a first post about <a href="https://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/06/19/contact/">how we met</a>. Check it out and subscribe for more stories in the future.</p>
