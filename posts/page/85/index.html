When I was a kid, I enjoyed tapping on tables in the style of a [Tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla) player. The sounds were fun. My mom used to say that I should learn the instrument. I never did. I think that was for the best since I don't seem to have any talent in playing a musical instrument.
<p>Even in those young days I had heard of the music of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakir_Hussain_%28musician%29">Ustad Zakir Hussain</a>. Zakir is regarded as the foremost player of the Tabla in the world. He has achieved unparalleled recognition and mastery with the Tabla and is a household name in India. Last night, Liz and I went to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlene_Schnitzer_Concert_Hall">Schnitz</a> for a concert by Zakir Hussain and the Masters of Percussion. It is an annual event hosted by <a href="https://www.kalakendra.org/">Kalakendra</a>. The group does a tour each year and the musicians change regularly. It was such beautiful and wide ranging music from a dozen different instruments of various Indian Classical schools. I was enthralled by the solo and group performances, especially the Tabla, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarangi">Sarangi</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitar">Sitar</a>.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we got to meet and chat with Zakir. He had such a jovial and warm demeanor. This was my first time at the event and I hope to go again.</p>

<p>On March 21st, I asked Liz to marry me and she said yes. She was elated that I asked her on a full-moon vernal equinox ;-)</p>
<p>We are both very happy and excited. I don&rsquo;t know who all read my blog, so probably you&rsquo;ve already seen me mention this on <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/2361035615/">Flickr</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/samgrover/statuses/776347132">Twitter</a> or in an email.

<section><p>The last time I bought a gaming console was in November, 2001. It was an Xbox. For the last six years, I&rsquo;ve used it exclusively as a DVD player.<img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2342/2338648273_62e9c8d0b2_m.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I bought a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_wii">Nintendo Wii</a> today. They are still in short supply. The local <a href="https://fredmeyer.com/">Fred Meyer</a> does a raffle when they get some stock. Last night they got twelve units. The raffle was scheduled for 6:45am today, fifteen minutes before opening time. I was first in line. Eleven people showed up. Everyone got a Wii.</p>
<p>I also got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and played it a bit today. It is so much fun.</p>
<p>If you like playing games, you should get a Wii.</p>

<section><p>Steve Novick is running a really cool campaign for U.S. Senate here in Oreon and it&rsquo;s great that Liz is part of it. They just released a <em>campaign beer</em> called &ldquo;Left Hook Lager&rdquo;. Liz made the label for that and <a href="https://galacticstillness.blogspot.com/2008/03/left-hook-lager.html">wrote about it here</a>. You can <a href="https://www.c-esystems.com/novick/lefthooklager.aspx">buy some for yourself</a>. Also, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2UesvrH-cs">beer themed ad</a> they came out with earlier this year.</p>
<p>On the subject of voting in general, I get the impression that people are so casual about <a href="https://samgrover.tumblr.com/post/27449669">counting the votes</a>. It&rsquo;s great to see The Onion impart its inimitable style to <a href="https://www.theonion.com/content/node/74800">the issue</a>. Attacks on voting machines can range from the sophisticated to the <a href="https://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/25/217240&amp;tid=172">cleverly simple</a>. Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Box_Voting">Black Box Voting</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Oh, and here&rsquo;s another yummy smoothie recipe:
Some Blueberries, some raspberries (little more than the blueberries), one banana, vanilla extract (to taste), two glasses of rice milk. Blend. Serves two. It&rsquo;s really nice. In fact I&rsquo;m going to make it right now.</p>

<section><p>There was some discussion today on Twitter regarding the first website made by people. That got me to look into my archives for the first one that I made.

</section>

<section><p>For the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve had a new personal assistant, <a href="https://iwantsandy.com/">Sandy</a>. I came to her after trying Backpack, Remember the Milk, Stikkit and others that I don&rsquo;t even remember any more. She&rsquo;s the best one I&rsquo;ve had so far. She makes me want her more. So far my girlfriend is cool with that, even though Sandy lives right here in Portland.</p>
<p>This weekend I saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica_%2528film%2529">Helvetica</a>. I got excited when I noticed that Movie Madness had it on their list but it was never in stock when I got there. On Saturday it wasn&rsquo;t on the shelves either, but Liz suggested that I peruse the un-shelved DVDs and there it was. I&rsquo;ve never thought about the history behind types. This film was enjoyable just for that. And there&rsquo;s a lot more about typography and graphic design in there. To top it all, the film is set to a really cool soundtrack.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I hung out with <a href="https://www.beerandblog.com/">Beer and Blog</a> peeps at the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne. The meeting was great. We touched on several topics and Justin has <a href="https://www.beerandblog.com/minutes-from-dashboards/">nicely summarized them</a>. I&rsquo;m looking forward to more such interactions. See photos <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/tags/beerandblog/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you&rsquo;ve noticed an increase in my blog posts over the last few days, it can be attributed to some extent to the wonderful <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>. It is a joy to compose and manage blog posts in it. I&rsquo;m still trying it out but at this point is looks like I&rsquo;ll be buying it well before the trial period runs out in about a month.</p>

<section><p>I&rsquo;ve updated <a href="https://samgrover.com/">my website</a> and moved the blog off to <a href="https://blog.samgrover.com/">https://blog.samgrover.com/</a>. I will update this feed to splice in more stuff at some point in the future. I&rsquo;ll let you know when I do that. You may want to move to <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/TheAptlyNamedSamsBlog">the blog only feed</a> now or later.</p>
<p>I tried Movable Type over the last two months and didn&rsquo;t like it much at all. So, I&rsquo;ve migrated the blog to  use <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. Wordpress has a lot of community support and plugins that make it a great choice. It also seems simpler to use and maintain. I continue to support <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a> for comments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna work on tweaking the look and feel of the website over the next few days so come back to check it out later. I&rsquo;ll also be expanding its focus.</p>

</section>

<section><p>It was heavier than I expected. I had ignored my cardinal law in purchasing a camera, &ldquo;Hold it in your hands to see how it feels&rdquo;. One year has gone by with me using <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/357893935/">the Bessa</a> exclusively, and I love it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/420818937/" title="Artist by samgrover, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/172/420818937_3eb85528cf_m.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I bought it along with a 50mm Nokton f/1.5 lens and an adapter. The camera has an M mount, whereas the lens is a screw mount, so I needed an adapter. My plan was that if I liked this enough I could get an M mount Leica lens in the future and it would fit just fine with the camera. I still plan on doing that. Perhaps a 35mm lens, but more on that later. I bought this Bessa at <a href="https://cameraquest.com/voigtr2ar3a.htm">CameraQuest</a>, a website that I haven&rsquo;t visited since then. I never planned on buying more of this system and I never had any issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/525781647/" title="Awaiting summer by samgrover, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1066/525781647_5b7580102c_m.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>My <a href="https://samgrover.com/2006/05/early-experience-with-a-rangef.php">early experience with a rangefinder</a> camera was in 2006 when I borrowed a <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/tags/canonetql17giii/show/" class="Plain">Canonet QL17 G-III</a> from my friend <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/old_sarge/">Doug</a>. At the end of that month I was hooked and understood why the rangefinder is the best camera for street photography. A sentiment expressed by many a famous street photographers of the last century. My favorite part about a rangefinder is that since I can see the frame lines, I can see the things that I&rsquo;m not including in the frame. You can never do that with an SLR. That allows me to frame the shot best, especially on the street when I have only a fraction of a second to frame and shoot a photo. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about focusing because I pre-focus and set a high depth-of-field. When I bring the camera to my eye, all I have to do is frame and click. And I love it when the camera goes &ldquo;click&rdquo;. The Bessa has a quick sharp sound that is barely noticeable as compared to the extended louder sound of the DSLR.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of the rangefinder is that you can see the photo at the moment of exposure, while in the SLR you just see nothing. As a result, at the beginning, my timing was  a bit off with this camera, but not only did I get used to it, I started to love it. Most of the time I take a photo, I just click one frame. No second chance. So it helps to know if I got what I was going for, even though the suspense remains until I actually get the film processed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/1429955514/" title="Swinging by samgrover, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1015/1429955514_2555d1be68_m.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Over the last year I&rsquo;ve put up 193 photos taken with this camera on <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/">my Flickr photostream</a>, about 76% of all my uploaded photos for 2007. That&rsquo;s not an immense number and probably would&rsquo;ve been even smaller had I not made the trips to <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157602125513976/show/">Burning Man</a> and to <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157603288998293/show/">India</a>. I put up 481 photos in 2006 and 807 photos in 2005. I think the trend is down because the cost of using film has made me frugal.</p>
<p>I like using film because of the texture that it imparts to a photograph. I haven&rsquo;t experimented a whole lot with different films, and settled quite early with Tri-X. Most of the time I push it to ISO 1600 and gives me just the right kind of contrast I like. It also helps to push the film in Portland, since most days are overcast and higher ISO films cost more ;-) Having said that, more and more manufacturers of are moving out of the 35mm film market. That trend has me thinking of digital rangefinders for the future. We&rsquo;ll see how that goes.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve spent enough time with the 50mm lens to now explore more primes. I would prefer to go wider, as that&rsquo;s what I find lacking sometimes when I frame a shot. Also, I think it would help me get closer while out on the street. So, sometime this year, I&rsquo;ll get a 35mm M mount lens, hopefully a Leica one. After all, that was the plan :-)</p>
