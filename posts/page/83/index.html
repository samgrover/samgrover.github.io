    >Trip to Porto, Portugal</a
  ><p>As I mentioned in my <a href="http://blog.samgrover.com/2008/06/19/whats-going-on/">last post</a>, (over two months ago!) I went to Portugal for a trip towards the end of July. I was attending the <a href="http://secrypt.org/">SECRYPT</a> conference and presenting my paper there. All I knew about Porto, was what I read on Wikipedia and other places online. I was looking forward to a cute historic European city and that&rsquo;s exactly what I got.</p>

    >What&#39;s going on?</a
  ><p>There&rsquo;s plenty going on.</p>
<p>My sister and her daughter came by to visit me from India last month. They were here for about a week and we all had a great time going around the Portland metro area and nearby to the gorge and coast. Here they are at Cannon Beach.</p>

Around the end of May, my landlord and I had a disagreement on the terms for a lease renewal at my current place. So, I decided to move out and started looking for a new place. I found a nice two bedroom condo [right by the river](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=620+NW+Naito+Pkwy,+Portland+OR+97209&amp;mrt=all&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=45.528178,-122.672825&amp;spn=0.009275,0.017252&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr) in NW Portland and will be moving there this weekend.
<p>I got a paper accepted to a conference called <a href="http://secrypt.org/">SECRYPT</a>. I will be going to present it at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto">Porto, Portugal</a> during the last few days of July. I just applied for a Visa and am looking forward to my first trip to Europe.</p></section>

    >New version of LazyEngine</a
  ><p>About three months after its <a href="http://blog.samgrover.com/2008/02/16/announcing-lazyengine/">initial launch</a>, I&rsquo;m happy to announce a new version of <a href="http://lazyengine.appspot.com/">LazyEngine</a>. I have moved it off my domain and onto the recently launched <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. This involved a rewrite of the code from the original PHP into the new Python version. This does not mean that it is any less lazy ;-)</p>
<p>I had wanted to add a feature to remember a user&rsquo;s past searches but was too lazy to implement that in PHP. With the new version, I get user logins automatically. You can use your Google accounts to log into LazyEngine and have it remember your searches from visit to visit. Give it a shot right now at <a href="http://lazyengine.appspot.com/">http://lazyengine.appspot.com/</a>. Enjoy!</p></section>

When I was a kid, I enjoyed tapping on tables in the style of a [Tabla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla) player. The sounds were fun. My mom used to say that I should learn the instrument. I never did. I think that was for the best since I don't seem to have any talent in playing a musical instrument.
<p>Even in those young days I had heard of the music of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakir_Hussain_%28musician%29">Ustad Zakir Hussain</a>. Zakir is regarded as the foremost player of the Tabla in the world. He has achieved unparalleled recognition and mastery with the Tabla and is a household name in India. Last night, Liz and I went to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlene_Schnitzer_Concert_Hall">Schnitz</a> for a concert by Zakir Hussain and the Masters of Percussion. It is an annual event hosted by <a href="http://www.kalakendra.org/">Kalakendra</a>. The group does a tour each year and the musicians change regularly. It was such beautiful and wide ranging music from a dozen different instruments of various Indian Classical schools. I was enthralled by the solo and group performances, especially the Tabla, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarangi">Sarangi</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitar">Sitar</a>.</p></section>

<p>On March 21st, I asked Liz to marry me and she said yes. She was elated that I asked her on a full-moon vernal equinox ;-)</p>
<p>We are both very happy and excited. I don&rsquo;t know who all read my blog, so probably you&rsquo;ve already seen me mention this on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/2361035615/">Flickr</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/samgrover/statuses/776347132">Twitter</a> or in an email.

  ><p>The last time I bought a gaming console was in November, 2001. It was an Xbox. For the last six years, I&rsquo;ve used it exclusively as a DVD player.<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2342/2338648273_62e9c8d0b2_m.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_wii">Nintendo Wii</a> today. They are still in short supply. The local <a href="http://fredmeyer.com/">Fred Meyer</a> does a raffle when they get some stock. Last night they got twelve units. The raffle was scheduled for 6:45am today, fifteen minutes before opening time. I was first in line. Eleven people showed up. Everyone got a Wii.</p></section>

  ><p>Steve Novick is running a really cool campaign for U.S. Senate here in Oreon and it&rsquo;s great that Liz is part of it. They just released a <em>campaign beer</em> called &ldquo;Left Hook Lager&rdquo;. Liz made the label for that and <a href="http://galacticstillness.blogspot.com/2008/03/left-hook-lager.html">wrote about it here</a>. You can <a href="https://www.c-esystems.com/novick/lefthooklager.aspx">buy some for yourself</a>. Also, check out this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2UesvrH-cs">beer themed ad</a> they came out with earlier this year.</p>
<p>On the subject of voting in general, I get the impression that people are so casual about <a href="http://samgrover.tumblr.com/post/27449669">counting the votes</a>. It&rsquo;s great to see The Onion impart its inimitable style to <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/74800">the issue</a>. Attacks on voting machines can range from the sophisticated to the <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/25/217240&amp;tid=172">cleverly simple</a>.

    >[Snacks] I Want Sandy, Helvetica, Beer and Blog, MarsEdit</a
  ><p>For the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve had a new personal assistant, <a href="http://iwantsandy.com/">Sandy</a>. I came to her after trying Backpack, Remember the Milk, Stikkit and others that I don&rsquo;t even remember any more. She&rsquo;s the best one I&rsquo;ve had so far. She makes me want her more. So far my girlfriend is cool with that, even though Sandy lives right here in Portland.</p>
<p>This weekend I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica_%2528film%2529">Helvetica</a>. I got excited when I noticed that Movie Madness had it on their list but it was never in stock when I got there. On Saturday it wasn&rsquo;t on the shelves either, but Liz suggested that I peruse the un-shelved DVDs and there it was. I&rsquo;ve never thought about the history behind types. This film was enjoyable just for that. And there&rsquo;s a lot more about typography and graphic design in there. To top it all, the film is set to a really cool soundtrack.</p></section>
