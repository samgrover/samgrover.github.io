<section><p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/3730f930c9.jpg" alt="Our new mail and keys organizer" title="Our new mail and keys organizer"></p>
<p>The mail and keys organizer located just inside our home entrance had to go. It couldn&rsquo;t handle our lifestyle, by which I mean, hold a bunch of mail of varying sizes for a bunch of days. Oh, and some keys and the super long IKEA shoehorn (the best!).</p>
<p>I began to dream up a new replacement as a woodworking project. I made a Pinterest board to get some design inspiration. Then one day I just sat down and sketched it out using <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com">GoodNotes</a> on my <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> using an <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/aadfa0bb9c.jpg" alt="Initial sketch of the organizer" title="Initial sketch of the organizer"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d imagined that the plywood would be 1/2&quot; thick, but after some discussion with Jenni, we decided to go for the <em>chonk</em> look that was distinctive of the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2019/03/25/a-tabletop-shelfbox.html">tabletop shelf/box</a> I made a couple of months ago. This lowered the costs as well since I already had  enough scraps of the baltic birch plywood. All I needed was the dark walnut stain, a birch dowel, and hanging hardware. The mail holders are held together by glue, and attached to the back by screws drilled in from behind. The pegs are held in by glue. There were a couple other changes as evident from the sketch and the photo of the final piece.</p>
<p>The groove detail in the pegs was Jenni&rsquo;s idea. I tried a couple of ways to cut it out and landed upon just keeping the table saw blade low and using my crosscut sled to spin the dowel in place over the blade. That worked wonderfully!</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/e2e7935f06.jpg" alt="Groove detail in pegs" title="Groove detail in pegs"></p>
<p>I finished the build a few weeks ago but the hardware I bought to hang it didn&rsquo;t work well. Then other things took up some time so I finally procured some new hardware and hung it up this week. We&rsquo;re both very happy with how it turned out.</p>
<p>And in parting, here&rsquo;s a photo of the old organizer trying hard to keep up.</p>

<section><p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/98821278f6.jpg" alt="Kyla, Herbie, Jenni, and Kelly near the top"></p>
<p>Last weekend we went hiking at <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Coyote_Wall_Hike">Coyote Wall</a>. Jenni and I had never been to this hike before but our friends were familiar with it.</p>
<p>There are multiple trails that meet each other at various points. Some are gentle slopes, while others are steeper. One can pick and choose paths based on how much of a workout one wants and switch that around as needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/0ed951ee0d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are beautiful vistas all along the way to the top of the wall. I could see myself bringing family and friends here that are not used to hiking much, to just go for a bit, enjoy the views, and head back.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/c9bc70af23.jpg" alt="">

<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/e3a9317ab9.jpg" alt="Herbie was happy to lead us for a bit"></p>
<p>There are cute little waterfalls and streams as well along the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/616eab7b26.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/8ae92658b4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Spring flowers, sunny weather, and spotty clouds, made everything look a lot more beautiful.</p>

<p>At the top, we hung out for a bit to have snacks and enjoy the views some more.</p>

<img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/a1221a6215.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On the way down we took the steeper route for a bit. Some folks were mountain biking along the cliff and down the steep trails, which was incredible to watch but not something I see myself doing 😅</p>

<img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/c48e3a44fa.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I can see myself coming back to this hike again in the spring, and probably in other seasons as well.</p>
