    >Hiking up Steamboat Rock</a
  >
</section>

<section><p>Steamboat Rock is the main feature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Rock_State_Park">Steamboat Rock State Park</a>, located by Banks Lake in central Washington. It has been an annual camping destination for Jenni&rsquo;s family for decades. This month was my first time there. We spent three nights at the campground there and had a wonderful time exploring the park and especially hiking up the rock.</p>
<p>The weather forecast had said that there may be thunderstorms with lightning the morning we were thinking of hiking up, but fortunately that warning moved to later in the day, so we got going a little before 10am.</p>
<p>There was a short trail that started right outside the campground and took us to the foot of the rock in a few minutes. This was a mostly flat, or a very gentle climb. There were five of us humans, and one very happy dog.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/b4ee634e37.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/b4ee634e37.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As we got closer the features of the rock became more discernible. The trail led us to the central part of the rock, to the start of the switchbacks that went up. Other trails lead there as well. Shortly before that was a picnic table, which seemed ideal for a pre/post hike snack.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/9274cf0c96.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/9274cf0c96.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>These initial switchbacks are a mix of loose rocks and gravel, or just rock. It was the trickiest part of the hike and lasted maybe a quarter mile, with a moderate to steep slope.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/1145837d48.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/1145837d48.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/8a286fbd54.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/8a286fbd54.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Once we were above that part, the view expanded and we had two options on the trail. We could&rsquo;ve gone right followed by a right-loop, or we could&rsquo;ve gone left, and done a left-loop. That day we went right.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/35cf886b72.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/35cf886b72.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>There was still more elevation to be gained for about a quarter mile before we reached the top of the rock. At this point we started the loop which went for a while along the edge. This afforded lovely views, starting with the campground area, followed by more expansive views of the lake, with rocky islands spotting it all over.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/5032c4373a.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/5032c4373a.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/65b8eca4bb.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/65b8eca4bb.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/efbc041cdb.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/efbc041cdb.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>After about twenty minutes of hiking and stopping to admire views, we came to the farthest point on the loop and the trail turned away from the edge. The return path was through grassy fields. To start, on our right there was a short slope to a lower elevation of a large field. In the distance we could see to the end of the rock plateau, then a gap and another large rock or hill beyond that.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/fa9311ed5d.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/fa9311ed5d.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/f4b8a74404.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/f4b8a74404.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>A short while of hiking on the plateau, with some gentle ups and down slopes, got us back to the start of the loop. Not much to see except a dramatic sky above and grassy fields on either side with a small variety of wildflowers.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/e7b050b515.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/e7b050b515.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>We made our way back to the fork in the middle of the rock, descended the switchbacks, and soon found ourselves on the last stretch of the trail.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/cb174978d9.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/cb174978d9.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>At this point the sky was <em>very</em> dramatic. It seemed like the thunderstorm was about to start, and we were glad to not be the highest objects in the vicinity anymore.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a little solar powered helicopter on Mars. It&rsquo;s named Ingenuity and it has a little camera on its belly that looks downwards. This video has every image taken by that camera from the first one on April 3, 2021 (Sol 43) until today. Ingenuity is 19 inches (0.49m) tall and weighs 4 lbs (1.8kg).</p>

  <time class="text-xs antialiased opacity-80"

  <a class="absolute inset-0 text-[0px]" href="https://samgrover.com/2022/06/16/mimi-uploader-is.html"
    >Mimi Uploader 2022.0 is out with new features for Recent Uploads 🎉</a
  >
</section>

<section><p>Recent Uploads used to show only the uploads you make from Mimi Uploader. With the new update it will also show uploads made to your Micro.blog account from anywhere else.</p>
<p>Mimi is primarily a batch uploader and that is my favorite way of using it. I like to make blog posts that have a set of photos, and making that process smoother was the motivation to create Mimi in the first place. As such, each batch of photos shows up in Recent Uploads as a set.</p>
<p>The other uploads to a Micro.blog account are only accessible as individual images and are shown inline with the sets of Mimi uploads in the same reverse chronological list. A badge is used to indicate one type or another. There are other minor UI differences between the two types in the list, e.g. Mimi uploads shows a count of images. On the top right is a filter button that lets you filter for one type or another, if you choose to do so. The screenshots below show the new interface.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/39c018e6a5.png"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/39c018e6a5.png" alt="Screenshots showing interface changes described above."></a></p>
<p>Exporting still works the same way with a right swipe. Sets of uploads made from Mimi can still be deleted with a left swipe. As always this only deletes the batch from Mimi and doesn&rsquo;t affect the uploaded images. Other uploads don&rsquo;t offer the deletion because they are representing the images on Micro.blog and not an uploaded set.</p>
<p>I hope you like this update as much as I liked making it.</p>

<section><p>After mulling over the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2022/05/06/sneak-peek-at.html">change to the Recent Uploads interface</a> over the last month, it seemed like the background color was a bit much, so I&rsquo;ve tweaked the design to show an icon on the right. I think this looks much better. An added benefit is that I can also add the icon to the filter menu on the top right so that the meaning becomes obvious.</p>

<section><p>Every morning I come into the living room and sit on the sofa and my brain says, &ldquo;Wordle&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;m soon playing that game. This has been going on for months.</p>
<p>Last week I went camping for three nights and I didn&rsquo;t think of Wordle a single time. The morning after I returned I went into the living room and sat on the sofa and my brain said, &ldquo;Wordle&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy how much of a pattern recognizer and responder the brain is, and how it makes these long lasting habits. Break a pattern briefly, lose a habit briefly.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/d186ce7979.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/d186ce7979.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing Wordle word game stats. Played, 191. Win %, 99. Current Streak, 5. Max Streak, 75"></a></p>
<p>Oh, and there was a time I used to get bothered by breaking a streak, but I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s behind me.</p>
