  <section><p>Over the last week or so I designed and built freestanding storage shelves in our basement. Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8w7XGiVMbs">this video</a>, and other similar ones, I decided that I would give it a go.</p>
<p>The basement had become a mess of stuff, about 70% of which was worth keeping. So we started by re-organizing what we wanted to keep and the rest we discarded/donated/gave-away.</p>
<p>On the 23rd I drew up the plan, and we went and bought the first set of materials from a <a href="https://52ndhardware.com">neighborhood building material store</a>, which has amazing people. Then came the holiday, so I didn&rsquo;t start to build until the 26th.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54543118548_065753a059_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54543118548_065753a059_h.jpg" alt="A photo of a basement wall with outlines for a shelving unit sketched on it. A black storage bin with a yellow lid sits on the concrete floor."></a></p>
<p>The first set took a while to make as I was new to it and wanted to make sure I got the measurements right as we had already got the plywood cut at the store. On the 27th I put the first shelf together.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54541999562_2c05ff7217_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54541999562_2c05ff7217_h.jpg" alt="Wooden storage shelves in a basement, holding yellow-lidded plastic containers, rolled-up fabric, boxes, and folded items. To the left, there are suitcases and folded tables. The background features a concrete wall and a window."></a></p>
<p>The design allows for expanding on either side, so right away I built an extension. This time it went really fast, even with a drive to the store to get more materials.</p>
<p>This second set had only two shelves that were half as deep so we didn&rsquo;t block the window, and also Jenni could place her paddle board bag vertically to easily pick up or drop off. I noticed that the there was a sag on this shelf, so later I added a strip of wood for additional support.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54543066719_c77ca7578e_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54543066719_c77ca7578e_h.jpg" alt="Wooden shelves in a basement with various storage items. Black and yellow plastic bins line the left shelf. A rolled-up fabric item sits on top. A large blue and black backpack, clear plastic bins with tools and supplies, and smaller blue bins are also visible."></a></p>
<p>On the 28th I built yet another extension. This time I didn&rsquo;t have enough plywood for three levels, so for the time being it only has two, but hey, those box fans fit nicely in there.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54543118618_9f54ebb39f_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54543118618_9f54ebb39f_h.jpg" alt="Wooden storage shelves in a basement with various items organized on them. Black and yellow storage bins, a wrapped blanket, a large backpack, stacked boxes, a covered item, clear plastic bins with contents, a power tool box, and two box fans."></a></p>
<p>Yesterday I completed another extension and that should be good for our current needs. From one end to another these shelves are 15 feet (~ 4.5m)</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54543118563_2a0773f1c6_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54543118563_2a0773f1c6_h.jpg" alt="Wooden shelving units in a garage storing various items, including black storage bins with yellow lids, a rolled-up item, a large backpack, plastic boxes, a box, etc."></a></p>
<p>I will observe how it performs, and have ideas to add more structural support if needed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really happy with how these turned out, and with our efforts, the entire space looks and feels so much better already.</p>
<p>P.S. As I was building this I also organized my basement shop that I hadn&rsquo;t used in a long time, including installing <a href="https://samgrover.com/2024/12/29/from-the-department-of-thingsishouldvedoneyearsago.html">these wall-mounted shelves</a> to hold lumber.</p>
<p>P.P.S The end posts are also 2x4s, but they look like 4x4s in the photo, likely due to distortion from the use of an ultra-wide lens.</p>
