<h1>Mimi Uploader is no longer in active development</h1>

Mar. 29, 2025


<br/><br/>
<p>I have decided to stop development of Mimi Uploader. The current beta will not be released, and there will be no more releases in the future.</p>
<p>The app will still be available in the App Store and continue to work. If I decide to remove it completely, I will give at least one month&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>I thank you all for your support over the five year lifespan of this app.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering why I&rsquo;ve decided to do this, please read on, although you might also want to read about <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/10/19/the-story-of.html">the history of Mimi Uploader</a> that I wrote 18 months ago.</p>
<p>So anyway, here are some reasons that went into the decision, although no single one was dominant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mimi Uploader&rsquo;s role as a utility has diminished over time as alternatives have become possible and accessible.</li>
<li>The app makes almost no money. When I introduced subscriptions for supporting development, there was support for some time, but it plateaued, and then reduced.</li>
<li>Micro.blog has been introducing new features for managing and displaying photos and providing alt text. To be clear, I&rsquo;m in support of that as these go to all users and make the service better for everyone, but they diminish the utility of Mimi, and also increase the burden of maintenance.</li>
<li>Some of the most ardent users and supporters have left the Micro.blog community in recent months.</li>
<li>I want to focus on newer projects and want to be clear to all users that this app is no longer a priority. If you subscribed to support development, then please feel free to cancel that subscription.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for a great five-year run ðŸ˜Š</p>
