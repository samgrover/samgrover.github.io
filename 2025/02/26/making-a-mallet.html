<p>Over the last few evenings, I built my first mallet. As I was making it, I made a big mistake, but I went on making it. I made other smaller mistakes but in the end I have a mallet, that, while not perfect, is a nice addition to my tools. I will only build better mallets in the future.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been attempting to do more of hand tool woodworking, which involves joinery that takes some effort with chisels to get right. I&rsquo;ve been using them with a cheap rubber mallet. That has worked fine but I wanted to make my own with hardwood.</p>
<p>I have some scraps lying around, and I found a nice piece of 1&quot; thick walnut (Western, I think) in there. The wood had mostly the characteristic dark brown of walnut, but it all had some lighter sap wood. I decided to make the handle from the sap wood, so that I would have some contrast between handle and head.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54518199898_deaee0bab8_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54518199898_deaee0bab8_h.jpg" alt="A wooden board is lying on a surface. A measuring tape is stretched across the wood, showing its length."></a></p>
<p>I cut the pieces to dimensions that made sense but here is where I made the big mistake. I cut the pieces of the head in a way that the edge grain ended up on the top and bottom of the head, rather than on the striking faces.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54517076927_b65ba654b6_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54517076927_b65ba654b6_h.jpg" alt="Several rectangular pieces of wood arranged on a light-colored surface."></a></p>
<p>But the cuts were made and I was committed. I knew I would make mistakes going into this so this didn&rsquo;t stop me from proceeding.</p>
<p>I lined up the pieces to shape the space for the handle in the head and glued up the pieces to form the head. This is where I made the second mistake. I had seen videos where the person would use a nail gun to hold the pieces in places, but I didn&rsquo;t have one, so I got some small finishing nails, and hammered them by hand. This led to misalignment of the pieces. As a result, once the head was all glued up, it had to be trimmed to form proper faces.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54517938611_2f9067fc3f_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54517938611_2f9067fc3f_h.jpg" alt="Pieces of wood glued and clamped together on a workbench, with clamps securing them in place. Woodworking tools and supplies are also visible."></a></p>
<p>I also chamfered and/or sanded every sharp edge using the band saw and the belt sander. In the end I had a nicely shaped head. The handle was a tight fit but I glued it up and hammered it into place.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54518199883_daae757dc8_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54518199883_daae757dc8_h.jpg" alt="A mallet head and a handle lie on a table. Nearby, there is a red sanding block and a black rubber mallet."></a></p>
<p>The next day I sanded, and cleaned up all surfaces and applied two coats of Watco Danish Oil (Natural). After letting it cure for a day or so, it is now ready. I&rsquo;m looking forward to chisel work with it in the near future.</p>
