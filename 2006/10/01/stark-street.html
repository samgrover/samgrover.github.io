<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/karmagroovy/" title="Russ">Russ</a> wanted to recreate the cover of The Beatles&rsquo; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road_%28album%29" title="Abbey Road">Abbey Road</a> album cover along with his wife, Patty and son, Riley. He planned the shot and scouted for locations, narrowing them down to two. So, on a Sunday morning we went out to take the shot. We were a bit early for the chosen locations. The light wasn&rsquo;t right. After a brief time looking around, we decided to go get breakfast and then return to take the shots.</p>
<p>On our way to <a href="http://www.laurelthirst.com/" title="LaurelThirst Public House">LaurelThirst</a>, we spotted an intersection on Stark Street and as fate would have it, it was better than the others and just right for the shot. Russ parked his Bug on the wrong side of the road and we started taking shots. They walked through the intersection once and I took some sample shots. After correcting their spacing and rhythm, I took shots of a few more passes with digital and film cameras. About fifteen minutes later, accomodating for light traffic, we were done and headed for a tasty breakfast. I had never tried to recreate a photo before. This was fun, and hopefully I&rsquo;ll do more in the future. We left out some details, like Paul&rsquo;s cigarette, Ringo, etc.</p>
<p>After going through the photos, Russ and family selected this shot as their favorite. Click on the image to see the larger version on flickr. There you will also find a link to the exact location on a map.</p>
