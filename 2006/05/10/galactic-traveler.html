Through her words and photography she will bring to us a taste of the life in Cambodia as she documents the grassroots development efforts of village folk. She will put nuggets of it on her <a href="http://www.villagefocusinthefield.blogspot.com/" title="Village Focus - In The Field">professional blog</a>.</p>
Her personal blog is <a href="http://galactictraveler.blogspot.com/" title="Galactic Traveler">Galactic Traveler</a>. There you can read her story and experiences over the years. Many of the posts tell interesting stories about her time in Afghanistan working for the UN for the last two years. See the one about the <a href="http://galactictraveler.blogspot.com/2005/07/here-in-middle-earth.html" title="Here in ">changes in Afghan society</a>, the one about the <a href="http://galactictraveler.blogspot.com/2005/11/bombing.html" title="The Bombing">bombing outside her office</a>, or the one about <a href="http://galactictraveler.blogspot.com/2005/11/kabul-feels-like.html" title="Kabul Feels Like ...">Kabul</a>, which has a really cool photo.
<p>She has a wonderful spirit of adventure and discovery, coupled with courage, resolve and that elusive human quality that makes instant friends of strangers. As one of those erstwhile strangers, I wish her the very best in her endeavours.</p>
