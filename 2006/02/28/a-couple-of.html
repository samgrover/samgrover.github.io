<h1>A couple of cool NPR shows</h1>

Feb. 28, 2006


<br/><br/>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a radio. On many occasions I&rsquo;ve heard people say good things about NPR and so recently I&rsquo;ve been listening to some of the podcasts offered by them. They are excellent programs and I thought I&rsquo;d recommend a couple to anyone interested in listening in.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/asc/">All Songs Considered</a>. It is hosted by Bob Boilen (sometimes in conversation with guests) and features newly available music from various artists. The selection is eclectic and I&rsquo;ve found some great new artists from listening to the show.</p>
<p>The second is <a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/">Science Friday</a>. It is hosted by Ira Flatow. He discusses various current issues in science with guests who are prominent members of the scientific community. The conversations are interesting and introduce me to a larger scientific domain than what I&rsquo;m used to hearing about in the computer science area.</p>
<p>They are both weekly shows, so it&rsquo;s not that hard to keep up. Check them out!</p>
