<p align="left">There are many cool things about this movie. The dialogues are peppered with [Nadsat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadsat), which Burgess invented. Some things made sense only on repeat viewing. That is probably one of the hallmarks of a cult movie, I guess. The movie is beautiful to look at, with lovely locations and colorful costumes. The performances are superb. But the best part, in my opinion, is the music. Beethoven's 9th Symphony forms a part of the story and is partially heard in Wendy Carlos' electronic rendition.</p>
<p align="left">See it. Again.</p>
