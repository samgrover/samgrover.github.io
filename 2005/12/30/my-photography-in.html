<h1>My photography in 2005</h1>

Dec. 30, 2005


<br/><br/>
<p>This has been a watershed year for my photography. I&rsquo;ve always had a casual interest in it, but this year I invested time and money into practicing it. The time came from shunning TV. I don&rsquo;t miss it. I recommend it. The money required was less than what would have been necessary in a pre-digital age. That made it affordable. <a title="flickr" href="http://flickr.com">flickr.com</a> has been a great influence as it has provided me with a community with whom to share, discuss, and enjoy photography. Thanks to all of them! I&rsquo;ve added two photos below that I liked a lot. You can click on them to see larger versions on flickr.</p>

I deliberately chose one B&amp;W and one color photo. I like working with both. The B&amp;W shot is film and the colored one is digital. Interestingly, both were very quick shots, about ten seconds from identifying to clicking. Both were taken on a street, first one in Portland and the second one in Seattle. I like taking pictures on the street and that is where I focus my efforts, even though these photos don't present the flavor of street photography that I like. In that regard, I particularly admire the work of <a title="Garry Winogrand on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Winogrand">Garry Winogrand</a>.
