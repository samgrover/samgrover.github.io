<p>Last night, just before I slept, a thought occurred to me and I visualized a photograph in my head. I woke up at 4:30am, and as the pre-dawn light started to illuminate the room, that photo popped back into my head. I couldn&rsquo;t get back to sleep and finally got out of bed at 5 AM.</p>
<p>I had some coffee and as the sun rose in a mostly cloudy sky, I decided I was gonna go and try to take that photo. I drove to the location, walked around to see the perspectives, and finally took the photo, and a couple more for good measure.</p>
<p>I took them on film so it remains to be seen how they turn out, but I&rsquo;m glad I went.</p>
