The background shows a park with people and buildings."></a></p>
<p>We were joined by two good friends who served as witnesses. The view from the courthouse was really nice.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2024/ef530189-d115-408b-8dab-d7a96cdf67e1.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2024/ef530189-d115-408b-8dab-d7a96cdf67e1.jpg" alt="Four people smiling for a selfie indoors with a scenic view of a river and bridges in the background. A man and woman in wedding attire are in the foreground, while two women in dresses stand behind them. The landscape suggests a sunny day."></a></p>
<p>It was a lovely day so we had an opportunity to get some pictures at the cherry blossoms by the river.</p>

<p>Following that we got some drinks and snacks and that was that. It was all we had hoped for.</p>
