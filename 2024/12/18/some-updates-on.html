  <section><p>I&rsquo;ve had a sneaking suspicion that <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">Mimi Uploader</a> does not have the value it once did. That some people, myself included, love it, but for most it is a novelty. I alluded to this <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/10/19/the-story-of.html">in a post</a> last year.</p>
<p>A couple months ago I made the app free for a promotional period until the end of the year (previously it has always been $5). I was hoping to get a better idea of the interest in the community once I remove the barrier to entry. Initially there were a lot of downloads, and sessions. Now, some months later, according to analytics that Apple provides, there is almost no change in usage.</p>
<p>Based on this experiment, I&rsquo;m making the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mimi Uploader will be permanently free starting 2025.</li>
<li>All major new features will be behind the Supporter subscription. You can become a Supporter by using the sliding scale in the app.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m working on adding initial support for Micro.blog&rsquo;s new <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/photo-collections/3366">Photo Collections</a> feature (<a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2024/collections-init.png">sneak peek</a>). This will be the first major new feature of the free era. At the end of the day Mimi&rsquo;s features are powered by Micro.blog&rsquo;s API so I&rsquo;m grateful to Manton for providing support from the get go.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m also starting the <a href="https://testflight.apple.com">TestFlight</a> beta testers group with a clean slate. If you would like to join the new group, please provide me your email address via email at sam @ samgrover dot studio. The first beta with initial photo collections support should be coming within the next week.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m also considering renaming the app as I expand the scope of features. Yes, there&rsquo;s another feature coming that has nothing to do with uploads.</li>
</ul>
<p>This way I can keep making an app I enjoy and find very useful, and anyone else really into it can also benefit from the new features. Everyone else can continue to use the app to its full initial promise as a fast batch uploader.</p>
