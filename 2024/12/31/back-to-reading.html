<p>Yes, these stats are silly, but perhaps you can think of other silly stats I could be tracking and charting? Let me know!</p>
<p>Oh, and if you&rsquo;re wondering which books, well, head on over to the <a href="https://samgrover.com/books/">books</a> page.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to more reading in 2025 😊</p>
