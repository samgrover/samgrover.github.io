<h1>A winter storm</h1>

Feb. 19, 2021

<p>About a week ago we were at the beginning of a &ldquo;historic&rdquo; winter storm. It had waves of various kinds of precipitation. Snow, sleet, ice, freezing rain, rain.</p>
<p>At the end of it there was the thickest layers of ice on everything that I&rsquo;d ever seen in these parts.</p>

<p>We lost power on Sunday night at 7pm. Thankfully, it was restored on Monday at 1:30pm. At one point we emptied the fridge of perishables and placed them in a cooler outside. At least there was plenty of ice around to keep things cold ðŸ˜„. I&rsquo;m grateful that this was a minor inconvenience to us compared to what many others are going through with recent weather.</p>
<p>All in all over 500,000 people were without power around here due to various causes, like downed power lines, equipment failures, substation failures. Crews have been working 24/7 to restore utilities.</p>

<p>It all began to thaw that Monday afternoon as the temperatures rose and the Sun came out for a while.</p>

<p>Now several days later, there&rsquo;s still plenty of downed tree branches, and snow on the ground thawing slowly. Temperatures have remained above freezing but sunshine is still rare.</p>
