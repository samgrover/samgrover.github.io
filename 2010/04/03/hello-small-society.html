<h1>Hello Small Society</h1>

<p>This blog post is long overdue and if you&rsquo;ve been following me on Twitter of Facebook, this is old news for you and you can just go ahead and skip to the last paragraph.</p>
<p>In March I left Intel to start working at <a href="http://smallsociety.com/">Small Society</a>. This has been an interesting and welcome change in my life and career. I was working on really cool computer security research at Intel Labs. However, on the side, I was gaining strong interest in developing apps with Cocoa on the Mac and iPhone OS platform ever since I started working on that over a year ago.</p>
<p>When I started to look around for a place to work on iPhone apps, Small Society was on the top of that list. Based in Portland, they have created apps for some of the leading brands in the world, including Starbucks, Whole Foods, Zipcar and Obama &lsquo;08. In fact the first draft of this post is being written on the iPad using the WordPress iPad app developed for Automattic by Small Society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an interesting seven weeks since I joined and I&rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying the work that I&rsquo;m doing and the people I&rsquo;m working with. We&rsquo;ve just hired two new people this week and are looking to hire a senior Cocoa developer. Check out <a href="http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/sof/1729464996.html">this job listing</a> on Craigslist for details.</p>
