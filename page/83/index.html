<section><p>I&rsquo;ve never blogged about my birthday before, which is strange because I&rsquo;ve had thirty-one of them. A few seconds ago I turned thirty-two.</p>
<p>Here are some personally memorable events since my last birthday:</p>
<ul>
	<li>October - Made a trip to India for dad's 60th birthday celebration.</li>
	<li>January - Got all four of my wisdom teeth extracted. Two had to be dug out. Was on a soup diet for a couple of weeks.</li>
	<li>February - Created the first version of the [LazyEngine](http://lazyengine.appspot.com/).</li>
	<li>March - Asked Liz to marry me. She said yes. Bought a Wii. The engagement was decidedly more memorable, but the Wii has been fun too :-)</li>
	<li>April - Attended a concert by Zakir Hussain and met him.</li>
	<li>May - Went to the hot springs at Brietenbush. Sis and niece came over to visit. We all had a great time.</li>
	<li>June - Moved to a new place right next to the river in NW Portland. Liz spoke at Ignite Portland 3.</li>
	<li>July - Liz and I made a [trip to Maine](http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/our-trip-to-maine/) to visit her parents and to spend the 4th of July holiday with them. Later that month, I traveled to Porto, Portugal to attend a conference. Lovely little city. It was my first time in Europe.</li>
	<li>August - Liz and I had our [Portland wedding](http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/we-got-married/). Our New Delhi wedding is in December. We went to Crater Lake for a weekend. Beautiful place. Our first time there. I traveled to San Francisco to showcase my work.</li>
	<li>September - I hacked together [ff2tweet](http://github.com/samgrover/ff2tweet/tree/master). Hope to refine it further in the future.</li>
</ul>
It was a wonderful year and I'm looking forward to the next one.
<p>And lastly, here&rsquo;s more about the number <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32_(number)">32</a>.</p>

</section>

<section><p>I got sick of reposting to Twitter what I had just posted to FriendFeed. I was doing that to enable conversations in both networks. I tried twitterfeed and Yahoo! Pipes, before deciding to just write a tool to do exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>ff2tweet is a tool to convert a FriendFeed post into a tweet and post it to Twitter. It does so while ensuring that the tweet is within the character limit and incorporates any comment made by the user when posting on FriendFeed. It also inspects the link in the post to shorten and add to the tweet as necessary.</p>
<p>ff2tweet is written in Python and I run it as a cron job on a server. It uses the FriendFeed and Twitter APIs to accomplish its task. It does what I wanted to do but it is a quick hack and there is definitely room for improvement. All feedback appreciated. The code is <a href="http://github.com/samgrover/ff2tweet/tree">available on github</a>. Join in!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on FriendFeed at <a href="http://friendfeed.com/samgrover">http://friendfeed.com/samgrover</a> and on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/samgrover">http://twitter.com/samgrover</a>.</p>

</section>

<section><p>As I mentioned in my <a href="http://blog.samgrover.com/2008/06/19/whats-going-on/">last post</a>, (over two months ago!) I went to Portugal for a trip towards the end of July. I was attending the <a href="http://secrypt.org/">SECRYPT</a> conference and presenting my paper there. All I knew about Porto, was what I read on Wikipedia and other places online. I was looking forward to a cute historic European city and that&rsquo;s exactly what I got.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/2705654507" title="View 'North of the Douro river' on Flickr.com">![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3215/2705654507_fb504dbc68_m.jpg)</a></p>
<p>I reached there on a Friday afternoon, quite jet-lagged. The hotel (Hotel Melia Gaia Porto) was in the area south of the Douro river called Vila Nova De Gaia. That evening I got food at a nearby place and explored about a mile around the hotel, partly in search of a wall adapter for my laptop power cord. Walking around Gaia reminded me of India, especially my maternal grandma&rsquo;s neighborhood in Delhi. The streets are narrow. The cars are small. Old rustic architecture is mixed with modern glassy facades.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/2706426294" title="View 'Streetscape' on Flickr.com">![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3126/2706426294_ac1ae192e7_m.jpg)</a></p>
<p>The conference was at the hotel and ran from Saturday thru Tuesday. Each day, I would attend sessions until about 6pm and then head out to explore the city. On Saturday I took a leisurely photowalk towards the city center. As I got closer to the river, historic buildings appeared and this time I was reminded of Bombay, which has a heavy Portugese influence. The extent of that influence was more than I realized. I rediscovered words that I thought were of Indian origin, only to find that they were in fact Portugese. In Bombay, the word for bread is &lsquo;pao&rsquo; and the word for potato is &lsquo;batata&rsquo;. Both of those are Portugese words. This discovery surprised my friends and family too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/2726032241" title="View 'Angles' on Flickr.com">![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3226/2726032241_fcd088a46c_m.jpg)</a></p>
<p>Over the next few days I explored several areas around the Porto city center. The metro was very convenient. On my last day there I went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_da_M%C3%BAsica">Casa da Música</a>. It is an interesting building with non-perpendicular corners and a variety of unique rooms. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was completely open to the public for free. You could just walk into and all around its various rooms, even into the main auditorium. You could sit at a Steinway grand piano and play to your heart&rsquo;s content and no one would bother. I didn&rsquo;t because I don&rsquo;t know how but a guy was doing just that.</p>
<p>Overall the trip was productive and pleasant, definitely whetting my appetite to explore more of Europe. My photos from the trip are in the slideshow below. You can follow it to the photos on flickr where you can view their location on a map.</p>

</section>

<section><p>There&rsquo;s plenty going on.</p>
<p>My sister and her daughter came by to visit me from India last month. They were here for about a week and we all had a great time going around the Portland metro area and nearby to the gorge and coast. Here they are at Cannon Beach.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="View 'Windy' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/2550493912">![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/2550493912_5e92c8b006_m.jpg)</a></p>
Around the end of May, my landlord and I had a disagreement on the terms for a lease renewal at my current place. So, I decided to move out and started looking for a new place. I found a nice two bedroom condo [right by the river](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=620+NW+Naito+Pkwy,+Portland+OR+97209&amp;mrt=all&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=45.528178,-122.672825&amp;spn=0.009275,0.017252&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr) in NW Portland and will be moving there this weekend.
<p>I got a paper accepted to a conference called <a href="http://secrypt.org/">SECRYPT</a>. I will be going to present it at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto">Porto, Portugal</a> during the last few days of July. I just applied for a Visa and am looking forward to my first trip to Europe.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.igniteportland.com/">Ignite Portland</a> 3 happened last night. This time Liz was a speaker. She spoke about her experiences of traveling to Afghanistan. She has a ton of stories and did an excellent job of squeezing a five minute rapid fire inspirational talk from them. There was a good variety of topics, just like at the last Ignite Portland, which made the evening quite entertaining. This time we went to the after party at <a href="http://www.takeitin.com/">Imbibe</a> and had a great time with friends, old and new. You can see her slides and video right here. They go quite well together.</p>

</section>

<section><p>About three months after its <a href="http://blog.samgrover.com/2008/02/16/announcing-lazyengine/">initial launch</a>, I&rsquo;m happy to announce a new version of <a href="http://lazyengine.appspot.com/">LazyEngine</a>. I have moved it off my domain and onto the recently launched <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. This involved a rewrite of the code from the original PHP into the new Python version. This does not mean that it is any less lazy ;-)</p>
<p>I had wanted to add a feature to remember a user&rsquo;s past searches but was too lazy to implement that in PHP. With the new version, I get user logins automatically. You can use your Google accounts to log into LazyEngine and have it remember your searches from visit to visit. Give it a shot right now at <a href="http://lazyengine.appspot.com/">http://lazyengine.appspot.com/</a>. Enjoy!</p>

When I was a kid, I enjoyed tapping on tables in the style of a [Tabla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla) player. The sounds were fun. My mom used to say that I should learn the instrument. I never did. I think that was for the best since I don't seem to have any talent in playing a musical instrument.
<p>Even in those young days I had heard of the music of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakir_Hussain_%28musician%29">Ustad Zakir Hussain</a>. Zakir is regarded as the foremost player of the Tabla in the world. He has achieved unparalleled recognition and mastery with the Tabla and is a household name in India. Last night, Liz and I went to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlene_Schnitzer_Concert_Hall">Schnitz</a> for a concert by Zakir Hussain and the Masters of Percussion. It is an annual event hosted by <a href="http://www.kalakendra.org/">Kalakendra</a>. The group does a tour each year and the musicians change regularly. It was such beautiful and wide ranging music from a dozen different instruments of various Indian Classical schools. I was enthralled by the solo and group performances, especially the Tabla, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarangi">Sarangi</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitar">Sitar</a>.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we got to meet and chat with Zakir. He had such a jovial and warm demeanor. This was my first time at the event and I hope to go again.</p>

<p>On March 21st, I asked Liz to marry me and she said yes. She was elated that I asked her on a full-moon vernal equinox ;-)</p>
<p>We are both very happy and excited. I don&rsquo;t know who all read my blog, so probably you&rsquo;ve already seen me mention this on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/2361035615/">Flickr</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/samgrover/statuses/776347132">Twitter</a> or in an email.

<section><p>The last time I bought a gaming console was in November, 2001. It was an Xbox. For the last six years, I&rsquo;ve used it exclusively as a DVD player.<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2342/2338648273_62e9c8d0b2_m.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_wii">Nintendo Wii</a> today. They are still in short supply. The local <a href="http://fredmeyer.com/">Fred Meyer</a> does a raffle when they get some stock. Last night they got twelve units. The raffle was scheduled for 6:45am today, fifteen minutes before opening time. I was first in line. Eleven people showed up. Everyone got a Wii.</p>
<p>I also got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and played it a bit today. It is so much fun.</p>
<p>If you like playing games, you should get a Wii.</p>

<section><p>Steve Novick is running a really cool campaign for U.S. Senate here in Oreon and it&rsquo;s great that Liz is part of it. They just released a <em>campaign beer</em> called &ldquo;Left Hook Lager&rdquo;. Liz made the label for that and <a href="http://galacticstillness.blogspot.com/2008/03/left-hook-lager.html">wrote about it here</a>. You can <a href="https://www.c-esystems.com/novick/lefthooklager.aspx">buy some for yourself</a>. Also, check out this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2UesvrH-cs">beer themed ad</a> they came out with earlier this year.</p>
<p>On the subject of voting in general, I get the impression that people are so casual about <a href="http://samgrover.tumblr.com/post/27449669">counting the votes</a>. It&rsquo;s great to see The Onion impart its inimitable style to <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/74800">the issue</a>. Attacks on voting machines can range from the sophisticated to the <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/25/217240&amp;tid=172">cleverly simple</a>. Check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Box_Voting">Black Box Voting</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Oh, and here&rsquo;s another yummy smoothie recipe:
Some Blueberries, some raspberries (little more than the blueberries), one banana, vanilla extract (to taste), two glasses of rice milk. Blend. Serves two. It&rsquo;s really nice. In fact I&rsquo;m going to make it right now.</p>

<section><p>There was some discussion today on Twitter regarding the first website made by people. That got me to look into my archives for the first one that I made. It was on Geocities and it doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore, not even on the <a href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>. But the second one that I made was hosted on the servers at <a href="http://www.pdx.edu/">PSU</a> and still exists on the aforementioned machine <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815110854/http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~satyajit/">here</a>. It was almost identical to the previous site and looked like this.</p>
