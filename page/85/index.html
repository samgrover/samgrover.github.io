    >Bombay blasts</a
  ><p align="justify">I was on my short commute today when I got a text message from my father in India. It said, " ... All ok in Mumbai. You may not be able to contact them as lines jammed ...". He was referring to my sister and her family. I didn't know what to make of this. I thought that perhaps the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5163288.stm" title="Hindu hardliners riot in Mumbai">Sunday incident</a> had flared up. I hadn't read the news this morning, so I called him and he told me about the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5169332.stm" title="Scores dead in Mumbai train bombs">bomb blasts</a>. Seven bombs went off on board various trains of the western lines within one hour (<a href="http://lastingnews.com/maps/mumbai_terror.php" title="Mumbai attacks">Mapped locations</a>). For more info and details from the blogosphere, see <a href="http://www.ultrabrown.com/posts/terrorists-blow-up-bombay-trains" title="Terrorists blow up Bombay trains">Ultrabrown</a>,  <a href="http://gauravsabnis.blogspot.com/2006/07/blasts-in-bombay.html" title="Blasts in Bombay">Vantage Point</a>, <a href="http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/003563.html" title="Bombay's rush hour rocked by blasts">Sepia Mutiny</a>, <a href="http://mumbaihelp.blogspot.com/" title="Mumbai Help">MumbaiHelp</a>, and <a href="http://mumbai.metblogs.com/" title="Metroblogging Mumbai">Metroblogging Mumbai</a>.

    >Google Spreadsheets and some related idle speculation</a
  ><p>I don't have any major need for spreadsheets, so I'm definitely not inclined to buy some software for it. But there are a few little things for which I could use one and that is why it's great to see a free web application from Google that provides it.</p>
<p>I started to use <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/" title="Google Spreadsheets">Google Spreadsheets</a> yesterday and found it very convenient and simple to use. It offers some basic functionality for now but that's ok since it's only a limited test. It can import and export <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLS" title="Microsoft Excel">XLS</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" title="Comma Separated Values">CSV</a> files at the moment, so I converted my few files from a simple text format into CSV and they were smoothly imported. The application looks quite slick. This is the first application from Google that looks a lot like a desktop application. It has menus near the top with similar items as a standard desktop application. There are buttons for the usual suspects; Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo and Redo. It has collaborative features to let multiple users edit the same file and provides a chat interface too. I haven't tried that yet. I'm looking forward to more such applications. I'm guessing that I'll use some of them while others I won't, picking and choosing depending on usage, usability and desktop alternative availability.</p></section>

The camera is a <a href="http://www.cameraquest.com/canql17.htm" title="Canonet QL17 G-III">Canonet QL17 G-III</a>. I've gone through one roll on it and it's been fun to use so far. I had been using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera" title="Single Lens Reflex camera">SLR</a> cameras until now and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangefinder_camera" title="Rangefinder camera">rangefinder</a> is quite different in operation. The major difference being that the image viewed through the viewfinder is not the same as the one that is seen by the lens. In an SLR you see through the lens, so it's more of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</a> interface. Here are some of my impressions with using this camera.</p></section>

    >Short stories</a
  ><p>I like reading, but unfortunately, I don't get much time to read for pleasure these days. Adding to that sorry state of affairs is the fact that I'm a slow reader. When I do read nowadays, it is more of <a href="http://samgrover.wordpress.com/tag/non-fiction/" title="My blog entries about non-fiction books">non-fiction</a>. On those rare occasions that I do read fiction, I love a good short story.</p>
<p>Apart from being concise, short stories stay focused and leave a lot to the imagination. They appeal to the minimalist in me. They build around a key idea or theme and my favorite kind have a twist or climax at the very end. An extreme and wonderful example is Ernest Hemmingway's six word story: &quot;For sale: Baby shoes. Never used&quot;.</p></section>

It has come up in conversations a couple of times so I thought I'd blog it and share. Maybe it's already well known.</p></section><nav class="mt-14 flex"><a class="btn not-prose" href="/page/84/"
