<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaupanger_Stave_Church">Kaupanger Stave Church</a> is one of the 28 stave churches (out of an estimated nearly 2000 that existed in the past) preserved in Norway. You can <a href="https://www.visitnorway.com/typically-norwegian/stave-churches/">read more about those here</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the graves were newer but there were a few that were pretty old, including one of a person born in the 1600&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54734086631_c1c5d7aeab_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54734086631_c1c5d7aeab_h.jpg" alt="A peaceful cemetery with rows of gravestones on a grassy hillside, surrounded by trees.

<p>As we were driving away I got this quick snapshot from a higher vantage point on the road that shows the church in the context of the village around it.</p>

<p>We were there for about an hour during our brief time in the Sogndal area. Even though we couldn&rsquo;t go inside, it was nice to see a place like this up close.</p>

</section>

<section><p>On our first day in Norway, I was guided by our group to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogner_Park">Frogner Park</a> where I was enamoured by sculptures made by Gustav Vigeland in bronze and stone.</p>
<p>They depict human forms, human relationships, and the eternal human condition.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54722597932_1539183199_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54722597932_1539183199_h.jpg" alt="Sculptures of human figures in a park, featuring a prominent statue of a couple embracing. Other statues depict various poses, set on stone pedestals, surrounded by greenery and a pathway."></a></p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54661771075_454d161394_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54661771075_454d161394_h.jpg" alt="Bronze statue of a dancing woman on a stone railing overlooking a sunny park lawn with scattered people sunbathing"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54722597757_1733258824_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54722597757_1733258824_h.jpg" alt="A bronze sculpture of a person sitting under a stylized tree is set against a backdrop of a large fountain with water cascading over its edge. A bird is flying in the sky above, with trees and a clear blue sky in the background."></a></p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54723648734_38a3fe1265_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54723648734_38a3fe1265_h.jpg" alt="Stone sculptures of human figures sit closely together in a park setting, with trees and a circular plaza in the background. The scene is captured in black and white."></a></p>
<p>The most prominent feature is the massive Monolith.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54670549303_64fed2f78b_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54670549303_64fed2f78b_h.jpg" alt="Black and white photo of the Monolith sculpture composed of intertwined human figures at the top of a grand stairway in Vigeland Park, with visitors nearby."></a></p>
<p>The metalwork on the gates around the monolith platform complements the sculptures.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54723764795_fb628156a7_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54723764795_fb628156a7_h.jpg" alt="Stone railing and staircase leading to a decorative metal gate with human figures, set against a clear blue sky and scattered clouds."></a></p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54723426111_90ddde4011_h.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54723426111_90ddde4011_h.jpg" alt="View of a large park with well-manicured lawns, intersecting pathways, and a central monument surrounded by sculptures. Trees and hills are visible under a clear blue sky."></a></p>
<p>These sculptures evoked a unique feeling of human connectedness in me. It seems unlikely that I will ever see them again but I&rsquo;m very glad I did.</p>

<section><p>I saw <a href="https://mastodon.social/@desater/114890411646667135">this post</a> the other day talking about a game called <a href="https://www.pastpuzzle.de/">past puzzle</a>. It&rsquo;s like wordle, but instead of guessing a word without hints, you are guessing a four digit year based on hints of historical events.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54691915846_92b4bee7f5_o.png"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54691915846_92b4bee7f5_o.png" alt="Screenshot of a pas puzzle game in progress."></a></p>
<p>I enjoyed it and have been playing it almost daily. I&rsquo;m not great at it, but as someone that likes to see or hear about historical trivia, it is kinda fun. The tricky ones are the ones where a numeral is repeated. I call it a win if I get close enough 😄</p>
<p>Along those lines, I also like this Wikipedia app driven widget that I&rsquo;ve had on my phone for a long time.</p>
<p><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54692172609_b6a6dcf0ff_o.jpg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54692172609_b6a6dcf0ff_o.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a Wikipedia app&rsquo;s widget on the iPhone home screen showing historical trivia from the current day in 1917."></a></p>

<section><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Opera_House">Oslo Opera House</a> feels like a plaza unfolded itself from the surface of the fjord and rose towards the sky like origami. The experience of walking up and over the building is unlike any other building I&rsquo;ve been in/on.</p>
