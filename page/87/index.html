</section>

<section><p align="justify">I was on my short commute today when I got a text message from my father in India. It said, " ... All ok in Mumbai. You may not be able to contact them as lines jammed ...". He was referring to my sister and her family. I didn't know what to make of this. I thought that perhaps the <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5163288.stm" title="Hindu hardliners riot in Mumbai">Sunday incident</a> had flared up. I hadn't read the news this morning, so I called him and he told me about the <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5169332.stm" title="Scores dead in Mumbai train bombs">bomb blasts</a>. Seven bombs went off on board various trains of the western lines within one hour (<a href="https://lastingnews.com/maps/mumbai_terror.php" title="Mumbai attacks">Mapped locations</a>). For more info and details from the blogosphere, see <a href="https://www.ultrabrown.com/posts/terrorists-blow-up-bombay-trains" title="Terrorists blow up Bombay trains">Ultrabrown</a>,  <a href="https://gauravsabnis.blogspot.com/2006/07/blasts-in-bombay.html" title="Blasts in Bombay">Vantage Point</a>, <a href="https://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/003563.html" title="Bombay's rush hour rocked by blasts">Sepia Mutiny</a>, <a href="https://mumbaihelp.blogspot.com/" title="Mumbai Help">MumbaiHelp</a>, and <a href="https://mumbai.metblogs.com/" title="Metroblogging Mumbai">Metroblogging Mumbai</a>. Unfortunately, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Mumbai_bombings" title="1993 Mumbai bombings">isn't the first time</a> this beloved city has been a target.</p>
<p align="justify">Just the other day, in conversation with friends, I was reminiscing my experiences with riding the trains in Bombay. I grew up there through most of the nineties, mid-teens to early twenties. Rush hour travel is the kind of thing you'd remember fondly only if you were nostalgic. The train cars are sometimes packed so tight, one could travel upright without either foot on the floor. 4.5 million people commute on the trains everyday. With that in mind, the horror of these events is inescapable. Emotions will run high, we'll all mourn, but the people of Mumbai will not be terrorized.</p>
<p align="justify">In 1993, in the days after the thirteen serial bomb blasts in two hours, there were billboards proclaiming that the city got back on it's feet within 24 hours. In memory of those who died, I hope that spirit prevails, that the aftermath is peaceful, and that the perpetrators are brought to justice.</p>

    >Google Spreadsheets and some related idle speculation</a
  >
</section>

<section><p>I don't have any major need for spreadsheets, so I'm definitely not inclined to buy some software for it. But there are a few little things for which I could use one and that is why it's great to see a free web application from Google that provides it.</p>
<p>I started to use <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/" title="Google Spreadsheets">Google Spreadsheets</a> yesterday and found it very convenient and simple to use. It offers some basic functionality for now but that's ok since it's only a limited test. It can import and export <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLS" title="Microsoft Excel">XLS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" title="Comma Separated Values">CSV</a> files at the moment, so I converted my few files from a simple text format into CSV and they were smoothly imported. The application looks quite slick. This is the first application from Google that looks a lot like a desktop application. It has menus near the top with similar items as a standard desktop application. There are buttons for the usual suspects; Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo and Redo. It has collaborative features to let multiple users edit the same file and provides a chat interface too. I haven't tried that yet. I'm looking forward to more such applications. I'm guessing that I'll use some of them while others I won't, picking and choosing depending on usage, usability and desktop alternative availability.</p>
<p>And now for the idle speculation part, which kinda builds on what I <a href="https://www.kottke.org/04/04/google-operating-system" title="GooOS, the Google Operating System">first read</a> a long time ago. This new product makes me wonder that with the <a href="https://code.google.com/" title="Google Code - Google&#039;s Developer Network">known</a> and unknown components below their web applications, Google probably has a development platform for hosting applications on their infrastructure. I wonder if they would make it available to developers too. Let's call it the <b>e</b>nvironment for <b>Go</b>ogle <b>D</b>evelopers, or eGoD ;-). They could potentially let eGoD applications reside on the developer's own hardware, but they can't really fulfill their &quot;<i><a href="https://www.google.com/corporate/" title="Company Overview">mission</a> to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful</i>&quot; if it's not on their own infrastructure*. A reason for developers to let Google host their eGoD applications may be to guarantee good performance by utilizing a large scale <a href="https://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20051117.html" title="Google-Mart - I, Cringely">distributed system</a> that is managed and maintained by Google. Another reason would be that all eGoD applications would be &quot;local&quot; to each other and to Google services so if they wish to exchange information, they would be able to do so very efficiently. I've read time and again that infrastructure is one of Google's main strengths and I think that is absolutely true.</p>
<p>A Google branded word processor based on <a href="https://www.writely.com/" title="Writely - The Web Word Processor">Writely</a> will surely come out soon. I don't know if these applications are the beginning of a <a href="https://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/06/06/google-announces-more-sleepless-nights-ahead-for-msft-product-managers/" title="Scobelizer">challenge to Microsoft Office</a>, at least not until the technologies and interfaces are more mature. However they demonstrate the capability of this imaginary eGoD platform. Such a development and hosting environment is bound to be disruptive in the desktop application ecosphere. Google may go after a big slice of the pie with Office, leaving the niche products to the small developers. Just like Microsoft did with their platform, Windows.</p>
<ul>
<li>By the way, they provide <a href="https://base.google.com/" title="Google Base">Google Base</a> for people to give them their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_web" title="Deep Web - Wikipedia">deep web</a> information.</li>

</section>

<section><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/153954606/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="https://static.flickr.com/61/153954606_bfdd8d8605_m.jpg" alt=""></a>I borrowed a rangefinder camera from a <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/old_sarge/" title="Photos from Old Sarge">friend</a> a couple of weeks ago. The camera is a <a href="https://www.cameraquest.com/canql17.htm" title="Canonet QL17 G-III">Canonet QL17 G-III</a>. I've gone through one roll on it and it's been fun to use so far. I had been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera" title="Single Lens Reflex camera">SLR</a> cameras until now and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangefinder_camera" title="Rangefinder camera">rangefinder</a> is quite different in operation. The major difference being that the image viewed through the viewfinder is not the same as the one that is seen by the lens. In an SLR you see through the lens, so it's more of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</a> interface. Here are some of my impressions with using this camera.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#039;s a little bizzare to see the lens through the viewfinder, but I got over that pretty soon.</li>
<li>It is well known that rangefinders are quiet because they don&#039;t have a moving mirror. Even so, I was surprised by the quietness of the mechanism.</li>
<li>The shutter priority operation threw me off for a while because I&#039;m used to shooting with aperture priority. It makes me think in terms of time, while I&#039;m used to thinking in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field" title="Depth of field">depth of field</a>, or rather not thinking much in terms of either by setting the parameters once and not messing with it unless really needed.</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/151705515/" title="Photo Sharing">![](https://static.flickr.com/50/151705515_58bd3e843d_m.jpg)</a>The hardest thing to do was the focusing. The viewfinder has a very small area to check the focus accurately, and its not something I could manage to do quickly. I found myself pre-focusing most of the time by reading the distance marking on the lens. So, I used the viewfinder only for framing, just before taking the picture. I like the speed of such operation, but have been reluctant to do pre-focusing before now. This camera kinda forced it upon me and I&#039;ll try to do it more often. I think it is a good skill to have for street photography, especially when using a manual focus mechanism. There is usually no time to focus.
<p>It's been <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/77921985/" title="Of course it&#039;s raining, d&#039;uh!">raining again</a> for the last week, so I haven't had any chance to shoot more with this camera. Hopefully things will clear up next week!</p>

</section>

<section><p>I like reading, but unfortunately, I don't get much time to read for pleasure these days. Adding to that sorry state of affairs is the fact that I'm a slow reader. When I do read nowadays, it is more of <a href="https://samgrover.wordpress.com/tag/non-fiction/" title="My blog entries about non-fiction books">non-fiction</a>. On those rare occasions that I do read fiction, I love a good short story.</p>
<p>Apart from being concise, short stories stay focused and leave a lot to the imagination. They appeal to the minimalist in me. They build around a key idea or theme and my favorite kind have a twist or climax at the very end. An extreme and wonderful example is Ernest Hemmingway's six word story: &quot;For sale: Baby shoes. Never used&quot;.</p>
<p>Here are some short stories that I came across on the internet in recent times. I think they are marvelous and recommend them to you, my imaginary readers. One for each of you three :-D</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lucis.net/stuff/clarke/9billion_clarke.html" title="The Nine Billion Names of God">The Nine Billion Names of God</a> by Arthur C. Clarke</li>
<li><a href="https://web.mit.edu/jona/www/lq1.html" title="The Last Question">The Last Question</a> by Isaac Asimov</li>
<li><a href="https://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/hb.html" title="Harrison Bergeron">Harrison Bergeron</a> by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.</li>

<section><p align="left">![](https://static.flickr.com/50/144411688_eae14d6f43_m.jpg)Meet Liz. She likes to travel. When she isn&#039;t traveling, she might be in Portland or Nepal. Right now she is in Asia where she is on assignment from <a href="https://villagefocus.org/" title="Village Focus International">Village Focus International</a>. Through her words and photography she will bring to us a taste of the life in Cambodia as she documents the grassroots development efforts of village folk. She will put nuggets of it on her <a href="https://www.villagefocusinthefield.blogspot.com/" title="Village Focus - In The Field">professional blog</a>.</p>
Her personal blog is <a href="https://galactictraveler.blogspot.com/" title="Galactic Traveler">Galactic Traveler</a>. There you can read her story and experiences over the years. Many of the posts tell interesting stories about her time in Afghanistan working for the UN for the last two years. See the one about the <a href="https://galactictraveler.blogspot.com/2005/07/here-in-middle-earth.html" title="Here in ">changes in Afghan society</a>, the one about the <a href="https://galactictraveler.blogspot.com/2005/11/bombing.html" title="The Bombing">bombing outside her office</a>, or the one about <a href="https://galactictraveler.blogspot.com/2005/11/kabul-feels-like.html" title="Kabul Feels Like ...">Kabul</a>, which has a really cool photo.
<p>She has a wonderful spirit of adventure and discovery, coupled with courage, resolve and that elusive human quality that makes instant friends of strangers. As one of those erstwhile strangers, I wish her the very best in her endeavours.</p>

<section><p>I got a promotional email from <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" title="Netflix">Netflix</a> today. They would like me to forward an offer of a free month of service to my friends and family. A few months ago I would have sent it out to some people, but Netflix's service has gotten progressively worse in recent times. I'll continue to be a subscriber for a while to see how it goes, but there is no way that I'm recommending it to others at this time.</p>

<section><p align="left">![](https://static.flickr.com/54/129896711_ddb39aa3f0_t.jpg)Wear them horizontally as shown in the picture. The bass sounds much better. They are more prone to slip out when used that way, but if you're not moving too much (just sitting, walking) they will be alright. I've been using them like that for months. It has come up in conversations a couple of times so I thought I'd blog it and share. Maybe it's already well known.</p>
