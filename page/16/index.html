<section><p>The latest version of Mimi Uploader is now out in the App Store. It has an option to subscribe on an ongoing basis to become a Supporter.</p>
<p>By becoming a Supporter, you are providing for the development and maintenance of the app on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>In the future, this will also provide access to features that have ongoing costs. You may have heard that the newest beta of the app has a feature for <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/12/15/mimi-uploader-enters.html">generating image description for alt text</a>. This is powered by a third-party API and will be the first of such features.</p>
<p>You can sign up to support on the Settings screen by selecting the option labeled, &ldquo;Become a Supporter&rdquo;. There are three levels of payment. Pick the level that works for you. Whatever level you pick, you get the same access. And for all levels, you have my gratitude.</p>
<p>Get Mimi Uploader from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">App Store</a>!</p>

</section>

<section><p>Last weekend we went on a hike at Brown Mountain in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucson_Mountains">Tucson Mountains</a>. It was recommended as a sunset hike so we went later than usual.</p>
<p>The hike is a loop and has a quick ascent going clockwise, then some ups and downs with the last mile or so pretty much flat. It was a very enjoyable hike that had wonderful views, and provided a nice workout with the variations.</p>

<section><p>I&rsquo;ve been working on getting a subscription option set up in Mimi so folks can provide support for ongoing development with a sliding scale. Until that is live in the app store, I can&rsquo;t launch the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/12/15/mimi-uploader-enters.html">alt text generation feature</a>, but it will remain available in the beta.</p>

</section>

<section><p>Gradually, then suddenly coming to the conclusion that the only way forward for Mimi Uploader is via a subscription model to support development and ongoing costs. And to offer that via various tiers to emulate a sliding scale for supporters.</p>
<p>It is tricky to make a subscription service or otherwise charge specifically for the AI image description feature even though it has ongoing cost. That&rsquo;s because in many scenarios you don&rsquo;t get the service you pay for, and it is out of my control. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>This API is in preview. It may be turned off and never become a regular API.</li>
<li>OpenAI currently rate limits the API use. Once several people are using this regularly, it is entirely possible to reach that limit.</li>
<li>OpenAI&rsquo;s service may be down.</li>
</ul>
<p>So a subscription, if offered, is about supporting the app, which in turn supports this feature, and more in the future, in a best-effort way. It cannot be a guarantee of service.</p>
<p>How do you feel about that?</p>

    >Mimi Uploader Enters the Future</a
  >
</section>

<section><p>A new beta of Mimi Uploader is now out. It adds a new feature to generate a draft of an image description for use as alt text. An example is at the end of this post. This feature is opt-in. You have to ask for an image description to be generated each time. If you don&rsquo;t then the app behaves as before.</p>
<p>Thank you for trying this out in the beta, which <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/AbjtGWge">you can join at this link</a>.</p>
<p>The way it works is that you tap the &ldquo;Generate&rdquo; button in the alt text editor. This sends a link to your previously uploaded photo to the service, which responds with the description. At the current time this feature only generates a description in English. Would you like to see an additional feature to translate the description into a different language? If so, please let me know the name of the language(s).</p>
<p>The API used for this feature is a paid service from a third-party. Each tap on &ldquo;Generate&rdquo; incurs a cost. If you would like to support this feature, in beta and afterwards, <a href="https://ko-fi.com/samgrover">please give a donation directly</a>, or drop a tip using the Settings page in the app. Many thanks to those of you who have already done so. All donations and tips are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>As I prepare to launch this, I want to add that ever since I added the alt text feature, it&rsquo;s sometimes been a barrier to me posting batches of photos because I wasn&rsquo;t always ready to write all the descriptions. It felt like a chore sometimes. This feature greatly removes that friction. I see it as a positive step in my blogging (which often has batches of photos), as well as a more accessible web.</p>
<h3 id="and-now-for-an-example-illustrating-this-feature">And now for an example illustrating this feature</h3>
<p>Some weeks ago <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/11/26/a-different-sunrise.html">I shared</a> the following photo:</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/351c4995-a75c-4818-8bb2-c00d38d9f912.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/351c4995-a75c-4818-8bb2-c00d38d9f912.jpg" alt="Colorful morning sunrise in the background and silhouetted porch in the foreground. In between there is a silhouette of a Joshua Tree."></a></p>
<p>The alt text I wrote at the time was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Colorful morning sunrise in the background and silhouetted porch in the foreground. In between there is a silhouette of a Joshua Tree.</p></blockquote>
<p>Using this feature, the alt text generated was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A picturesque sunset with vibrant shades of pink, orange, and blue over a desert landscape with silhouettes of Joshua trees. Foreground includes the silhouette of a barbecue grill and patio with hanging light bulbs under a corrugated metal awning.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m very impressed by this description. It is spot on for everything except confusing a photo of a sunrise for a sunset, which is something many people do as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, every alt text in <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/12/12/photos-from-some.html">this post full of photos</a> was generated using this feature.</p>
<p>I hope you find this feature useful in your blogging as well. I look forward to your feedback.</p>
