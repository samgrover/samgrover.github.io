</section>

<section><p>For the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve had a new personal assistant, <a href="https://iwantsandy.com/">Sandy</a>. I came to her after trying Backpack, Remember the Milk, Stikkit and others that I don&rsquo;t even remember any more. She&rsquo;s the best one I&rsquo;ve had so far. She makes me want her more. So far my girlfriend is cool with that, even though Sandy lives right here in Portland.</p>
<p>This weekend I saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica_%2528film%2529">Helvetica</a>. I got excited when I noticed that Movie Madness had it on their list but it was never in stock when I got there. On Saturday it wasn&rsquo;t on the shelves either, but Liz suggested that I peruse the un-shelved DVDs and there it was. I&rsquo;ve never thought about the history behind types. This film was enjoyable just for that. And there&rsquo;s a lot more about typography and graphic design in there. To top it all, the film is set to a really cool soundtrack.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I hung out with <a href="https://www.beerandblog.com/">Beer and Blog</a> peeps at the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne. The meeting was great. We touched on several topics and Justin has <a href="https://www.beerandblog.com/minutes-from-dashboards/">nicely summarized them</a>. I&rsquo;m looking forward to more such interactions. See photos <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/tags/beerandblog/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you&rsquo;ve noticed an increase in my blog posts over the last few days, it can be attributed to some extent to the wonderful <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>. It is a joy to compose and manage blog posts in it. I&rsquo;m still trying it out but at this point is looks like I&rsquo;ll be buying it well before the trial period runs out in about a month.</p>

</section>

<section><p>I&rsquo;ve updated <a href="https://samgrover.com/">my website</a> and moved the blog off to <a href="https://blog.samgrover.com/">https://blog.samgrover.com/</a>. I will update this feed to splice in more stuff at some point in the future. I&rsquo;ll let you know when I do that. You may want to move to <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/TheAptlyNamedSamsBlog">the blog only feed</a> now or later.</p>
<p>I tried Movable Type over the last two months and didn&rsquo;t like it much at all. So, I&rsquo;ve migrated the blog to  use <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. Wordpress has a lot of community support and plugins that make it a great choice. It also seems simpler to use and maintain. I continue to support <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a> for comments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna work on tweaking the look and feel of the website over the next few days so come back to check it out later. I&rsquo;ll also be expanding its focus.</p>

</section>

<section><p>It was heavier than I expected. I had ignored my cardinal law in purchasing a camera, &ldquo;Hold it in your hands to see how it feels&rdquo;. One year has gone by with me using <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/357893935/">the Bessa</a> exclusively, and I love it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/420818937/" title="Artist by samgrover, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/172/420818937_3eb85528cf_m.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I bought it along with a 50mm Nokton f/1.5 lens and an adapter. The camera has an M mount, whereas the lens is a screw mount, so I needed an adapter. My plan was that if I liked this enough I could get an M mount Leica lens in the future and it would fit just fine with the camera. I still plan on doing that. Perhaps a 35mm lens, but more on that later. I bought this Bessa at <a href="https://cameraquest.com/voigtr2ar3a.htm">CameraQuest</a>, a website that I haven&rsquo;t visited since then. I never planned on buying more of this system and I never had any issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/525781647/" title="Awaiting summer by samgrover, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1066/525781647_5b7580102c_m.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>My <a href="https://samgrover.com/2006/05/early-experience-with-a-rangef.php">early experience with a rangefinder</a> camera was in 2006 when I borrowed a <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/tags/canonetql17giii/show/" class="Plain">Canonet QL17 G-III</a> from my friend <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/old_sarge/">Doug</a>. At the end of that month I was hooked and understood why the rangefinder is the best camera for street photography. A sentiment expressed by many a famous street photographers of the last century. My favorite part about a rangefinder is that since I can see the frame lines, I can see the things that I&rsquo;m not including in the frame. You can never do that with an SLR. That allows me to frame the shot best, especially on the street when I have only a fraction of a second to frame and shoot a photo. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about focusing because I pre-focus and set a high depth-of-field. When I bring the camera to my eye, all I have to do is frame and click. And I love it when the camera goes &ldquo;click&rdquo;. The Bessa has a quick sharp sound that is barely noticeable as compared to the extended louder sound of the DSLR.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of the rangefinder is that you can see the photo at the moment of exposure, while in the SLR you just see nothing. As a result, at the beginning, my timing was  a bit off with this camera, but not only did I get used to it, I started to love it. Most of the time I take a photo, I just click one frame. No second chance. So it helps to know if I got what I was going for, even though the suspense remains until I actually get the film processed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/1429955514/" title="Swinging by samgrover, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1015/1429955514_2555d1be68_m.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Over the last year I&rsquo;ve put up 193 photos taken with this camera on <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/">my Flickr photostream</a>, about 76% of all my uploaded photos for 2007. That&rsquo;s not an immense number and probably would&rsquo;ve been even smaller had I not made the trips to <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157602125513976/show/">Burning Man</a> and to <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157603288998293/show/">India</a>. I put up 481 photos in 2006 and 807 photos in 2005. I think the trend is down because the cost of using film has made me frugal.</p>
<p>I like using film because of the texture that it imparts to a photograph. I haven&rsquo;t experimented a whole lot with different films, and settled quite early with Tri-X. Most of the time I push it to ISO 1600 and gives me just the right kind of contrast I like. It also helps to push the film in Portland, since most days are overcast and higher ISO films cost more ;-) Having said that, more and more manufacturers of are moving out of the 35mm film market. That trend has me thinking of digital rangefinders for the future. We&rsquo;ll see how that goes.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve spent enough time with the 50mm lens to now explore more primes. I would prefer to go wider, as that&rsquo;s what I find lacking sometimes when I frame a shot. Also, I think it would help me get closer while out on the street. So, sometime this year, I&rsquo;ll get a 35mm M mount lens, hopefully a Leica one. After all, that was the plan :-)</p>

</section>

<section><p>Ever since I heard &ldquo;Lawyers, Guns and Money&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve wanted to hear more of <strong>Warren Zevon</strong>&rsquo;s music. So this week I bought &ldquo;The Best Of Warren Zevon&rdquo; at <a href="https://amazonmp3.com/">Amazon&rsquo;s MP3</a> store. I&rsquo;ve listened to it twice and now there are a few more of his songs that I really like.</p>
<p>A new favorite song is <strong>Lily Allen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alfie&rdquo;</strong> which I first heard way back, and then again recently on the podcast of the wonderful NPR show, <a href="https://npr.org/allsongs">All Songs Considered</a>. It&rsquo;s quite pop-ish.</p>
<p><strong>Recipe for a smoothie:</strong> Two Frozen Bananas, Three Frozen Strawberries, One Frozen Peach, Vanilla extract (to taste), Two glasses rice milk. Blend. Serves two. Experiment with quantities!</p>
<p><strong> Mesmerized</strong> by Phillipe Halsman&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/monkeyc/95165918/">Dali Atomicus</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Yay for soups!</strong> I got my wisdom teeth extracted and am <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/2191291976/">mostly eating soups</a>.</p>

<section><p>I don&rsquo;t like calling any photo of mine a favorite, but some are just more interesting than others. Two years ago I listed <a href="https://samgrover.com/2005/12/my-photography-in-2005.php">just a couple of photos</a>. This year, I&rsquo;ve gone overboard with ten!</p>

<section><p>I just moved this blog here from it&rsquo;s previous incarnation at <a href="https://samgrover.wordpress.com/">https://samgrover.wordpress.com/</a>. I&rsquo;m quite impressed at the ease with which I was able to export the previous blog and import it here intact with the entries and the comments. My thanks to the folks behind <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress </a>and <a href="https://movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>. Subscribe to the <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/samgrover">new feed</a>!</p>
<p>That move was simple. Now I have to move to my new place in real space this weekend. Unfortunately, that will involve some more work! Portland has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland%2C_Oregon#Sections_and_neighborhoods">five quadrants</a>. Yea, five. Portland is weird. I used to live in the Southwest and then I was in the Southeast for the last 18 months and now I will be moving into a small house in the Northeast. It will increase my daily commute, but overall it will be great! By the way, the fifth quadrant is North, in case you were wondering.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been sharing this video with friends since I first saw it some months ago. It&rsquo;s informative and elegant and the music is cool too. It provokes my curiosity, especially with the way it ends. Take a look!</p>

<section><p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I updated this blog. About ten months. I&rsquo;ve been an intern at Intel during that period and I recently joined as an employee.</p>
<p>Also, now it&rsquo;s been one year since I moved to the SE Portland. I like it here. I have a hour-or-so long commute each way on <a href="https://www.trimet.org/" title="TriMet">TriMet</a>, which isn&rsquo;t terribly bad as it gives me time to read. However, public transit doesn&rsquo;t work too well when there are more things to do in a day, especially in different parts of town. Even though my schedule at work is quite flexible, public transit can become a bottleneck. That occurs when I want to do more than go to work in the morning and return home in the evening. I thought that was sufficient excuse for me to go in for a car ;-) and placed an order for a new Mini Cooper S in April. I expect to have delivery within a month and am looking forward to that. It will be my first car.</p>
<p>My photography has been up and down during this time. In January, I sold off my Nikon D70S digital SLR and bought a <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/357893935/" title="Voigtländer Bessa R2A">Voigtländer Bessa R2A</a> film rangefinder. After playing with cameras and photography for a couple of years I had come to realize just the kind of camera that would work best for me. The Bessa fit that bill quite well. It was also quite affordable as compared to <a href="https://www.leica-camera.us/photography/m_system/m7/" title="Leica M7">another option</a>. My previous <a href="https://samgrover.wordpress.com/2006/05/27/early-experience-with-a-rangefinder-camera/" title="Early experience with a rangefinder camera">experience with a rangefinder</a> was definitely a motivating factor. I will write more about my experiences with this camera in a future post.</p>
