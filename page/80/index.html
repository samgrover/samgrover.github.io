    >On buying a house</a
  ><p>On 11th February in 2015, I decided to buy a house in Portland.</p>
<p>At the time I was working on my laptop at Hivolt, a coffee shop in New Orleans. I ordered a cup of pourover coffee named Burundi Buziraguhindwa. The menu described it as ‚Äúnatural sundried, juicy, strawberry, raspberry‚Äù. Turned out to be one of the best coffees I‚Äôve ever had. It was the catalyst, because a few minutes later I had made the decision. When I told Jenni about it, she started calling it ‚Äúmagic coffee‚Äù. I love her.</p></section>

    >Thirty-four</a
  ><p>Today I turned thirty-four.</p>
<p>Here are some personally memorable events since <a href="http://blog.samgrover.com/2009/10/11/thirty-three/">my last birthday post</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>March - Liz and I spent a weekend at Newport on the Oregon coast. The highlight was the visit to the Oregon Coast Aquarium. Also, after three-and-a-half years at Intel, I left to join Small Society to make cool iOS apps. I started at Small Society on 22nd March.</li>
	<li>June - While in LA, Liz had to undergo emergency surgery for the removal of her ruptured appendix. She returned home a week after that and has recuperated well. Got an iPhone 4 which has a decent enough camera that for the first time ever I'm comfortable with my phone being the only camera on my person when I travel.</li>
	<li>July - I had to fly down to LA and drive our car back from there since we flew Liz up to Portland after her surgery. Traded in the MINI for a Subaru Outback.  We had to [let Yoshi go](http://blog.samgrover.com/2010/08/01/goodbye-yoshi/).</li>
	<li>August - My parents visited us in Portland and we had a great time showing them around Portland. We also visited Seattle, Crater Lake and Bend.</li>
	<li>September - Visited Disney World in Florida for ten days. It was a vacation for us and a chance for my parents to meet Liz's parents for the first time. We all had a great time there. I also visited family in Chicago for a few days.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was another amazing year and I‚Äôm looking forward to the next one.</p></section>

    >Goodbye Yoshi</a
  ><p>It was less than a year ago that we said hello to <a href="http://blog.samgrover.com/2009/09/29/yoshi/">Yoshi</a>. Unfortunately and unexpectedly now it&rsquo;s time to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Yoshi started to show symptoms of great discomfort yesterday morning and we noticed blood in his urine shortly before noon. We immediately called his regular vet but they were about to close and asked us to go to <a href="http://www.lvhvet.com/">Laurelhurst Veterinary Hospital</a> (LVH) instead. So off we went. After his examination the doctor informed us that he is having urinary tract issues. He&rsquo;s had other health issues earlier this year. The doctor informed us that since he is having these issues really early in his life, he will need constant medical attention and care in the future. Their best treatment recommendation greatly exceeded what we can afford right now. Combined with other unexpected financial events from this summer and the expected upcoming travels, it soon became apparent that we would have to make a hard decision. We informed the doctor of our predicament. She offered that they have a process in place to adopt a pet in such a circumstance, to nurse them back to health and put them up for adoption. With great sadness we decided to surrender Yoshi to their care. This way he gets the best, immediate, and adequate care and will find a new home with someone who can address his future needs as well. There are no words for our heartfelt gratitude to the folks at the LVH for adopting him into their care.</p></section>

    >Hello Small Society</a
  ><p>This blog post is long overdue and if you&rsquo;ve been following me on Twitter of Facebook, this is old news for you and you can just go ahead and skip to the last paragraph.</p>
<p>In March I left Intel to start working at <a href="http://smallsociety.com/">Small Society</a>. This has been an interesting and welcome change in my life and career. I was working on really cool computer security research at Intel Labs. However, on the side, I was gaining strong interest in developing apps with Cocoa on the Mac and iPhone OS platform ever since I started working on that over a year ago.</p></section><nav class="mt-14 flex"><a class="btn not-prose" href="/page/79/"
