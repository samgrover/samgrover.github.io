<section><p>Sometime last year my friend Andrew made me aware of the sensors and software he was using to monitor temperature and humidity in his home. I thought that was cool and it introduced me to several hardware and software tools that I had not known about. I wanted to set this up at my home so I filed a project for a later date.</p>
<p>Well, that day arrived a few weeks ago and here&rsquo;s what it looks like today:</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/7387c64251.png"><img src="https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/7387c64251.png" alt="Screenshot showing charts of temperature and humidity time series."></a></p>
<p>To get started exploring this I purchased an <a href="https://amzn.to/3ky05hO">AcuRite bundle</a> of three sensor towers and one display. I set up the towers around my home and put the display in my home office. It was neat to see the display showing the measurements at any given time. Soon I wanted to go to the next level and record and see the data over time.</p>
<p>These sensors broadcast the data over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPD433">433 MHz</a> and there are consumer level antennas and software available to read this data. I bought a <a href="https://amzn.to/3Y6Ew5x">NooElec bundle</a> which gave me all the hardware I needed to receive this data on my computer. Setting it up was straightforward. I used <a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433">rtl_433</a> and was able to start seeing the wireless data immediately in the terminal on my Mac.</p>
<p>The next step was storing all this data. That&rsquo;s where <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb">influxdb</a> came in. And the glue to get it from <code>rtl_433</code> to <code>influxdb</code> involved <a href="https://mqtt.org">MQTT</a> and <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf">telegraf</a>.</p>
<p>There was a lot of trial and error but I finally got it all set up and was able to get the data into <code>influxdb</code>. I even made a dashboard in there to visualize it. The options on that dashboard were limited so I got <a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana">grafana</a> set up and built a dashboard in that which can be seen at the top of this post as seen on my desktop browser. It also looks great on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Except for <code>rtl_433</code>, the rest of the tools all run on docker on my desktop Mac. At some point I may migrate that off to a Raspberry Pi but for now it&rsquo;s all working and I&rsquo;m going to take a break from any further optimizing/tweaking for now.</p>
<p><strong>Update (6th March, 2023):</strong> <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/03/06/adding-api-accessible.html">Follow up post</a> about expanding on this effort.</p>

<section><p>📽️ Over the weekend we saw the <a href="https://shorts.tv/theoscarshorts/">2023 Oscar Animated Shorts</a> at a local theater. That was the first time I had gone to see something like that and it was quite enjoyable. Most of the films are a delight. The theater had cozy seats and serves brunch so that made it a little extra fun.</p>

    >The Origin Story of Walmart Labs in Portland</a
  >
</section>

<section><p>Today I came across this <a href="https://siliconflorist.com/2023/02/14/walmart-is-shuttering-walmart-labs-office-in-portland/">Silicon Florist article</a> about the closing of the Walmart office in Portland. It&rsquo;s definitely the end of an era.</p>
<p>After reading it, I couldn&rsquo;t help but clarify a few things about the origin story 😬</p>
<p>Quoting from the article,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a town that has been less than welcoming to Walmart, it may be a bit of head-scratcher how they wound up with a regional technology office here. The answer, like so many other regional offices in town, is through acquisition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Acquisition, yes, but not the one of Small Society as the article alludes.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/walmart-labs-acquires-set-direction--9ff4c45b">April 2011</a>, <a href="https://almaer.com/blog/helping-set-direction-at-walmart">Walmart Labs acquired Set Direction</a> which had been building the Walmart iOS app, and more. At the time Set Direction had one employee WFH in Portland. Next month I joined the team.</p>
<p>A short while later we hired a third person and rented a conference room at <a href="https://collectiveagency.co">Collective Agency&rsquo;s</a> first location in NW Portland. When our team expanded to five people over a couple more months, we moved into the first proper Walmart Labs office at <a href="https://www.theonemainplace.com">One Main Place</a> in November 2011. During that time we built and released the first few versions of the native iOS SDK based Walmart app.</p>
<p>Quoting again from the article,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After being acquired in 2012, Small Society took on the moniker of Walmart Labs, serving as a regional technology office for the retail giant and continued to be a presence — albeit a much quieter presence — within the local startup community, even taking up residence in coworking spaces around town.</p></blockquote>
<p>Walmart Labs existed in Portland for the better part of a year before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/04/walmartlabs-acquires-mobile-agency-small-society/">the Small Society acquisition in January 2012</a>. And while Walmart Labs worked out of a coworking space for a few months, Small Society (as part of Walmart Labs) never did. After the acquisition they continued to operate from their existing office.</p>
<p>For eight months Walmart Labs was split across two offices until we all moved into the space above the erstwhile Rock Bottom Brewery (2nd and Morrison) in September 2012.</p>
<p>Edited to clarify: During recent years Walmart Labs did move into a coworking space but that was long after all the original people had moved on.</p>
