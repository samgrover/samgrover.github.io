That move was simple. Now I have to move to my new place in real space this weekend. Unfortunately, that will involve some more work! Portland has five quadrants. Yea, five. Portland is weird. I used to live in the Southwest and then I was in the Southeast for the last 18 months and now I will be moving into a small house in the Northeast. It will increase my daily commute, but overall it will be great! By the way, the fifth quadrant is North, in case you were wondering."/>

<p>I just moved this blog here from it&rsquo;s previous incarnation at <a href="http://samgrover.wordpress.com/">http://samgrover.wordpress.com/</a>. I&rsquo;m quite impressed at the ease with which I was able to export the previous blog and import it here intact with the entries and the comments. My thanks to the folks behind <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress </a>and <a href="http://movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>.

<p>That move was simple. Now I have to move to my new place in real space this weekend. Unfortunately, that will involve some more work! Portland has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland%2C_Oregon#Sections_and_neighborhoods">five quadrants</a>. Yea, five. Portland is weird. I used to live in the Southwest and then I was in the Southeast for the last 18 months and now I will be moving into a small house in the Northeast. It will increase my daily commute, but overall it will be great! By the way, the fifth quadrant is North, in case you were wondering.</p>
