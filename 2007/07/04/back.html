<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I updated this blog. About ten months. I&rsquo;ve been an intern at Intel during that period and I recently joined as an employee.</p>
<p>Also, now it&rsquo;s been one year since I moved to the SE Portland. I like it here. I have a hour-or-so long commute each way on <a href="http://www.trimet.org/" title="TriMet">TriMet</a>, which isn&rsquo;t terribly bad as it gives me time to read. However, public transit doesn&rsquo;t work too well when there are more things to do in a day, especially in different parts of town. Even though my schedule at work is quite flexible, public transit can become a bottleneck. That occurs when I want to do more than go to work in the morning and return home in the evening. I thought that was sufficient excuse for me to go in for a car ;-) and placed an order for a new Mini Cooper S in April. I expect to have delivery within a month and am looking forward to that. It will be my first car.</p>
<p>My photography has been up and down during this time. In January, I sold off my Nikon D70S digital SLR and bought a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/357893935/" title="Voigtländer Bessa R2A">Voigtländer Bessa R2A</a> film rangefinder. After playing with cameras and photography for a couple of years I had come to realize just the kind of camera that would work best for me. The Bessa fit that bill quite well. It was also quite affordable as compared to <a href="http://www.leica-camera.us/photography/m_system/m7/" title="Leica M7">another option</a>. My previous <a href="http://samgrover.wordpress.com/2006/05/27/early-experience-with-a-rangefinder-camera/" title="Early experience with a rangefinder camera">experience with a rangefinder</a> was definitely a motivating factor. I will write more about my experiences with this camera in a future post.</p>
