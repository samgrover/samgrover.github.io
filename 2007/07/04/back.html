<p>My photography has been up and down during this time. In January, I sold off my Nikon D70S digital SLR and bought a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/357893935/" title="Voigtländer Bessa R2A">Voigtländer Bessa R2A</a> film rangefinder. After playing with cameras and photography for a couple of years I had come to realize just the kind of camera that would work best for me. The Bessa fit that bill quite well. It was also quite affordable as compared to <a href="http://www.leica-camera.us/photography/m_system/m7/" title="Leica M7">another option</a>. My previous <a href="http://samgrover.wordpress.com/2006/05/27/early-experience-with-a-rangefinder-camera/" title="Early experience with a rangefinder camera">experience with a rangefinder</a> was definitely a motivating factor. I will write more about my experiences with this camera in a future post.</p>
