[{"content":"\nA little over a week ago we visited Oregon Contemporary to experience A Larger Reality, an exhibit about the life and work of Ursula K. Le Guin.\nA framed structure about the size of the room that served as Le Guin\u0026rsquo;s writing room, when not serving as a nursery, was surprisingly small. On the desk were her typewriters that were open to use. I enjoyed this level of immersiveness.\nThe electric typewriter was programmed to print selections of Le Guin\u0026rsquo;s work for visitors to print and take with them.\nIt was a lovely exhibit and I\u0026rsquo;m glad we were able to visit it. I have read some of Le Guin\u0026rsquo;s works, and have others on my reading list for this year and beyond. I would highly recommend her work to anyone.\n","date":"2026-01-11","dateFormatted":"January 11, 2026","excerpt":"\nA little over a week ago we visited Oregon Contemporary to experience A Larger Reality, an exhibit about the life and work of Ursula K.

A few interesting notes:\nThankful to the Multnomah County Library system for borrowing about half of them, including the nice physical copy of How to See. A couple were public domain books from the wonderful Standard Ebooks project. I will be returning to pick from there again for sure. I listened to my first ever audiobook, The Silmarillion. It was a great book for that format as it was written like a mythology and that might have lost my interest if I were to read it. Also, there were lots of interesting names that I would\u0026rsquo;ve surely pronounced badly. A good balance of fiction/non-fiction and genres therein really kept my interest going, just like I had mused about a year ago.

So as the values start coming in like 3, 1, 4, etc, the second hand jumps by those many seconds.\nI started to write the code for a Mac app but Quartz 2D drawing is not something I have ever really done, so it was tricky wrapping my mind around the coordinate system and laying out individual marks on the canvas.\nFast forward to yesterday when I decided to try out vibe coding for this project. As I got going though, it became more of an AI assisted coding because I started to edit it myself after a couple of initial rounds of code generation. Old habits die hard!\nFor this purpose I used the recently released Google\u0026rsquo;s Gemini 2.5 Pro via LLM, essentially as described in this post.\nI was very impressed by the code generation. The first prompt I gave was for a static drawing, and it was thus:\nllm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 \u0026#34;Write a SwiftUI View that draws a clock face on a Canvas. It should draw each of the 60 tick marks, with 0 and every multiple of 5 being a slightly thicker tick mark. It should also draw the time using an hour hand, a minute hand and a second hand. The second hand should be red. The time should be 10th hour, 10th minute, 30th second.\u0026#34; The result was exactly as I expected. It even improvised and put that little circle in the center which was a nice touch.\nThen I gave it this second prompt which also included the Piterator.swift code:\nfiles-to-prompt . -e swift -c | \\ llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 -s \\ \u0026#39;Update the ClockView to make it animatable using TimelineView. Then hook it up to Piterator so that every second, the second hand moves forward by as many seconds as the number returned by the Piterator.\u0026#39; This generated code that had a couple of small bugs that raised compiler errors.

As I was making it, I made a big mistake, but I went on making it. I made other smaller mistakes but in the end I have a mallet, that, while not perfect, is a nice addition to my tools. I will only build better mallets in the future.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been attempting to do more of hand tool woodworking, which involves joinery that takes some effort with chisels to get right. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using them with a cheap rubber mallet. That has worked fine but I wanted to make my own with hardwood.\nI have some scraps lying around, and I found a nice piece of 1\u0026quot; thick walnut (Western, I think) in there. The wood had mostly the characteristic dark brown of walnut, but it all had some lighter sap wood. I decided to make the handle from the sap wood, so that I would have some contrast between handle and head.\nI cut the pieces to dimensions that made sense but here is where I made the big mistake. I cut the pieces of the head in a way that the edge grain ended up on the top and bottom of the head, rather than on the striking faces.\nBut the cuts were made and I was committed. I knew I would make mistakes going into this so this didn\u0026rsquo;t stop me from proceeding.\nI lined up the pieces to shape the space for the handle in the head and glued up the pieces to form the head. This is where I made the second mistake. I had seen videos where the person would use a nail gun to hold the pieces in places, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have one, so I got some small finishing nails, and hammered them by hand. This led to misalignment of the pieces. As a result, once the head was all glued up, it had to be trimmed to form proper faces.\nI also chamfered and/or sanded every sharp edge using the band saw and the belt sander. In the end I had a nicely shaped head. The handle was a tight fit but I glued it up and hammered it into place.\nThe next day I sanded, and cleaned up all surfaces and applied two coats of Watco Danish Oil (Natural). After letting it cure for a day or so, it is now ready. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to chisel work with it in the near future.\n","date":"2025-02-26","dateFormatted":"February 26, 2025","excerpt":"\nOver the last few evenings, I built my first mallet.

The idea being that it would house my new 3D printer, and also have room for other projects that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do in the dusty environment of the woodworking area. I drew up a rough plan on a photo and it came to 12 feet by 2 feet.\nIts frame would be made of 2x4 lumber held together with pocket screws (a first for me, so I went and bought a jig!). The top would have two layers of 3/4\u0026quot; plywood. It didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be fancy, so I decided to use more of the same birch plywood I\u0026rsquo;d used for the storage shelves.\nInstalling the frame was a little bit tricky but I managed to do it by myself by stacking some boxes for support, and attached it to the bare studs with lag screws.\nThen it was time to make the front legs. The floor in the basement is not only not level but also has lumpy concrete in some spots. So each leg had to be constructed by trial and error for the place it would stand.\nNow I was ready to build the surface which had a base, and a top. The base went on pretty quickly. I screwed down from the top to attach it to the frame. The top was made of the same plywood but I finished it with two coats of polyurethane using a spray. Spray was a bad idea, but more on that later. I installed the top by screwing up from underneath the base.\nAfter a week I started to build the other half. It was the same process but due to issues with the studs, I had to cut a couple of dados.\nThe rest of it went smoothly, and I lined it up as best as I could with the first half.\nNext I fastened 2x2 boards all along the edges, and mounted a strip of the same plywood along the back, and with that, it was completed.\nSo far I don\u0026rsquo;t feel the need for all the legs I had in the sketch, but I can add more if needed.\nLessons were (hopefully) learned. Mainly to not use spray poly to finish a large flat surface, and also not to do it in the house, even if it was in the rough basement. I finished the second one in the shed.\n","date":"2025-02-12","dateFormatted":"February 12, 2025","excerpt":"After building storage shelves towards the end of the year, I turned my eyes to the other side of that area and decided to build a workbench there.

Inspired by this video, and other similar ones, I decided that I would give it a go.\nThe basement had become a mess of stuff, about 70% of which was worth keeping. So we started by re-organizing what we wanted to keep and the rest we discarded/donated/gave-away.\nOn the 23rd I drew up the plan, and we went and bought the first set of materials from a neighborhood building material store, which has amazing people. Then came the holiday, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t start to build until the 26th.\nThe first set took a while to make as I was new to it and wanted to make sure I got the measurements right as we had already got the plywood cut at the store. On the 27th I put the first shelf together.\nThe design allows for expanding on either side, so right away I built an extension. This time it went really fast, even with a drive to the store to get more materials.\nThis second set had only two shelves that were half as deep so we didn\u0026rsquo;t block the window, and also Jenni could place her paddle board bag vertically to easily pick up or drop off. I noticed that the there was a sag on this shelf, so later I added a strip of wood for additional support.\nOn the 28th I built yet another extension. This time I didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough plywood for three levels, so for the time being it only has two, but hey, those box fans fit nicely in there.\nYesterday I completed another extension and that should be good for our current needs. From one end to another these shelves are 15 feet (~ 4.5m)\nI will observe how it performs, and have ideas to add more structural support if needed.\nI\u0026rsquo;m really happy with how these turned out, and with our efforts, the entire space looks and feels so much better already.\nP.S. As I was building this I also organized my basement shop that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t used in a long time, including installing these wall-mounted shelves to hold lumber.\nP.P.S The end posts are also 2x4s, but they look like 4x4s in the photo, likely due to distortion from the use of an ultra-wide lens.\n","date":"2025-01-02","dateFormatted":"January 2, 2025","excerpt":"Over the last week or so I designed and built freestanding storage shelves in our basement.

That some people, myself included, love it, but for most it is a novelty. I alluded to this in a post last year.\nA couple months ago I made the app free for a promotional period until the end of the year (previously it has always been $5). I was hoping to get a better idea of the interest in the community once I remove the barrier to entry. Initially there were a lot of downloads, and sessions. Now, some months later, according to analytics that Apple provides, there is almost no change in usage.\nBased on this experiment, I\u0026rsquo;m making the following changes:\nMimi Uploader will be permanently free starting 2025. All major new features will be behind the Supporter subscription. You can become a Supporter by using the sliding scale in the app. I\u0026rsquo;m working on adding initial support for Micro.blog\u0026rsquo;s new Photo Collections feature (sneak peek). This will be the first major new feature of the free era. At the end of the day Mimi\u0026rsquo;s features are powered by Micro.blog\u0026rsquo;s API so I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to Manton for providing support from the get go. I\u0026rsquo;m also starting the TestFlight beta testers group with a clean slate. If you would like to join the new group, please provide me your email address via email at sam @ samgrover dot studio. The first beta with initial photo collections support should be coming within the next week. I\u0026rsquo;m also considering renaming the app as I expand the scope of features. Yes, there\u0026rsquo;s another feature coming that has nothing to do with uploads. This way I can keep making an app I enjoy and find very useful, and anyone else really into it can also benefit from the new features. Everyone else can continue to use the app to its full initial promise as a fast batch uploader.\n","date":"2024-12-18","dateFormatted":"December 18, 2024","excerpt":"I’ve had a sneaking suspicion that Mimi Uploader does not have the value it once did.

I even tooted a comparison of a RAW image processed by me along with an \u0026ldquo;Apple Processed\u0026rdquo; image, both captured in Halide. Apparently I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only one confused, as per the discussions in the official subreddit.\nI thought that the PZ adjustments were in the RAW file but they are actually only in the HEIC / JPG file, that is \u0026ldquo;developed\u0026rdquo;, and essentially redeveloped every time one makes adjustments in the app\u0026rsquo;s Image Lab interface.\nOnce I had this clarity I tried it in various scenarios, and finally appreciated the result instead of just the theory and examples presented in the announcement.\nSo far my favorite PZ images have been a couple of black and white photos I shared in this post a few days ago.\nI also shared the one above on Glass and had a small conversation with Tom that started to crystallize my thoughts on it:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a nice option to have in the toolkit but of limited use for someone like me. If I was a phone-only photographer I might be more excited. Also, I like the lack of computational photography but I have no nostalgia for older digital cameras.\nGrain, in film, was a limitation that became an aesthetic, and in the digital age, an emulation. It appears that digital noise is going down the same road for some photographers and is part of their nostalgia for older digital cameras. The interest in that aesthetic is also a rejection of computational photography (with its artificial look) as the sole creative path forward for photographers on the iPhone.\nWhile a photographer\u0026rsquo;s admonishment of computational photography is usually commentary, Halide\u0026rsquo;s admonishment comes in the form of Process Zero. It is a breath of fresh air in the current environment of computational photography. It embraces constraints, which is a powerful force for creativity.\n","date":"2024-08-21","dateFormatted":"August 21, 2024","excerpt":"Over the last week I’ve explored Halide app’s new Process Zero (PZ) feature.\nFor the first couple of days I misunderstood what the PZ image was and how to get it.

So are models for the weather, or for star formation. But most laypersons, like myself are not enthralled by them because they are domain specific models requiring expertise to use.\nThe main reason large language models appeal to laypersons, such as myself is that they are a language model, and we\u0026rsquo;ve been utilizing languages all our lives. The way language influences thought, and thereby social interactions, makes these models so much more about people and society.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s incredibly more relevant, and deserves every bit more scrutiny, than a weather model telling me that I might see some clouds today if I even bother to look up.\n","date":"2024-06-25","dateFormatted":"June 25, 2024","excerpt":" I like to tell people that everything an LLM says is actually a hallucination.

The helicopter, named Ingenuity, was a 30-day technology demonstration sent to see if we could fly an aircraft in the very thin Martian atmosphere.\nAs is often with NASA\u0026rsquo;s robotic missions to Mars in recent times, it did that, and exceeded all expectations. It became a companion to the rover and performed about 70 flights over the nearly three years that it flew on Mars. Then last month it encountered an accident that left one of its propeller damaged. That ended the mission.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been fascinated by this little flying helicopter and have often looked at the photos it was sending back. So much so that I have now compiled a video of all the photos taken by the navigation camera on Ingenuity. This downward pointing camera photographs the ground below it, and so the helicopter is always seen by its shadow, scuttling about the Martian landscape for a cumulative 17 km (10.5 miles) over its mission timeline.\nNo doubt, Ingenuity has shown that a flying robot is a very useful tool in exploring Mars, like wheeled rovers showed over the last few decades. Perhaps enough that future missions will bring more along.\nFor more information and a lot more interesting media, like the locations of all these flights, check out its official website.\nDirect link to video file\n","date":"2024-02-07","dateFormatted":"February 7, 2024","excerpt":"When Perseverance rover landed on Mars, it brought along a little helicopter in its belly.

It may be turned off and never become a regular API. OpenAI currently rate limits the API use. Once several people are using this regularly, it is entirely possible to reach that limit.

It adds a new feature to generate a draft of an image description for use as alt text. An example is at the end of this post. This feature is opt-in. You have to ask for an image description to be generated each time. If you don\u0026rsquo;t then the app behaves as before.\nThank you for trying this out in the beta, which you can join at this link.\nThe way it works is that you tap the \u0026ldquo;Generate\u0026rdquo; button in the alt text editor. This sends a link to your previously uploaded photo to the service, which responds with the description. At the current time this feature only generates a description in English. Would you like to see an additional feature to translate the description into a different language? If so, please let me know the name of the language(s).\nThe API used for this feature is a paid service from a third-party. Each tap on \u0026ldquo;Generate\u0026rdquo; incurs a cost. If you would like to support this feature, in beta and afterwards, please give a donation directly, or drop a tip using the Settings page in the app. Many thanks to those of you who have already done so. All donations and tips are greatly appreciated.\nAs I prepare to launch this, I want to add that ever since I added the alt text feature, it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes been a barrier to me posting batches of photos because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t always ready to write all the descriptions. It felt like a chore sometimes. This feature greatly removes that friction. I see it as a positive step in my blogging (which often has batches of photos), as well as a more accessible web.\nAnd now for an example illustrating this feature Some weeks ago I shared the following photo:\nThe alt text I wrote at the time was:\nColorful morning sunrise in the background and silhouetted porch in the foreground. In between there is a silhouette of a Joshua Tree.\nUsing this feature, the alt text generated was:\nA picturesque sunset with vibrant shades of pink, orange, and blue over a desert landscape with silhouettes of Joshua trees. Foreground includes the silhouette of a barbecue grill and patio with hanging light bulbs under a corrugated metal awning.\nI\u0026rsquo;m very impressed by this description. It is spot on for everything except confusing a photo of a sunrise for a sunset, which is something many people do as well.\nAdditionally, every alt text in this post full of photos was generated using this feature.\nI hope you find this feature useful in your blogging as well. I look forward to your feedback.\n","date":"2023-12-15","dateFormatted":"December 15, 2023","excerpt":"A new beta of Mimi Uploader is now out.

First I started using Micro.blog regularly. I like putting together sets of photos, so I often have posts with those. Soon thereafter I realized it was a pain to manage uploading a series of photos for a post. Thankfully Micro.blog provided an API. So I wrote a python script that would do that from the command line on my Mac, and that greatly eased the friction.\nSome time later I noticed that very often I was taking the step of moving photos from my phone to my Mac (or over iCloud), exporting them, and then using the script to do the upload. Often even for single photos. This increased over time as I used my big camera less often and most of my photos came from the iPhone.\nNow, I\u0026rsquo;m always looking for app ideas to try and improve my skills as a professional iOS developer. It was with that in mind that I started the side project that later came to be Mimi Uploader.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t want to make the app free as I was wary of supporting too many users and feature requests for a side project. This was just before subscriptions on iOS became a focus of Apple and a source of much consternation amongst the community. And I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready to wade into that for this side project so I set it up as a one-time purchase for $4.99. Mimi has remained at that price since it started in early 2020.\nAs time passed, people in the community started to notice and recommend it, and even Micro.blog encouraged, supported, and promoted it, for which they all have my gratitude.\nSince Mimi Uploader was a side project that helped me learn and acquire new skills on iOS I was glad to put in the time to maintain it when I had any to spare. And yes, the evolution of software platforms means that there is a constant need for that labor. At some point I thought that perhaps people want to support ongoing maintenance, so I added a tip jar in the app. And some people tipped some times, for which they have my gratitude as well.\nEvery enhancement has been implemented because I wanted it, or because someone in the community asked for it.\nAnd now four years have passed in total.\nThe Present Mimi Uploader remains a passion project that is at the mercy of my spare time and spare motivation. So I continue with maintenance and small enhancements every now and then.\nI should also mention that in the intervening four years that march of software platform evolution has led to a plethora of ways to accomplish what Mimi does, further diminishing its utility.\nThe Future I have no idea. What do you think?\nEdited to add: This is not a call for feature requests. There\u0026rsquo;s already an extensive list of that.\n","date":"2023-10-19","dateFormatted":"October 19, 2023","excerpt":"This is about an iOS/iPadOS app I make, called Mimi Uploader.\nThe Past This is all from memory, so let me apologize in advance for any errors/omissions.\nThe concept of Mimi Uploader as an app came …","image":"","title":"The Story of Mimi Uploader So Far","url":"/2023/10/19/the-story-of.html","year":"2023"},{"content":"hike muddy\nmushrooms water\nfalls in love\nagain\n","date":"2023-10-09","dateFormatted":"October 9, 2023","excerpt":"hike muddy\nmushrooms water\nfalls in love\nagain\n","image":"https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/06e58ad4-2de0-4dac-9896-619f27608d7e.jpg","title":"hike muddy\nmushrooms water\nfalls in love\nagain\n","url":"/2023/10/09/hike-muddymushrooms-waterfalls.html","year":"2023"},{"content":"\n","date":"2023-10-04","dateFormatted":"October 4, 2023","excerpt":"\n","image":"https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/194e8167-1eb2-4b04-afaa-7822879f0d02.jpg","title":"\n","url":"/2023/10/04/220034.html","year":"2023"},{"content":"This is what it looks like when your partner is running a half marathon, and you’re chasing them all over the place 🚴‍♂️\n","date":"2023-10-01","dateFormatted":"October 1, 2023","excerpt":"This is what it looks like when your partner is running a half marathon, and you’re chasing them all over the place 🚴‍♂️\n","image":"https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/2a231294-20cd-44da-bbf6-61cbbb77bb21.png","title":"This is what it looks like when your partner is running a half marathon, and you’re chasing them all over the place 🚴‍♂️\n","url":"/2023/10/01/this-is-what.html","year":"2023"},{"content":"Came across Momo reading Viticci\u0026rsquo;s iOS 17 review.

This is not a post about that, but about my personal experience.\nI arrived about an hour before the keynote. After going through the security check, I made my way to Caffé Macs where the event was set up. There was food and beverages. I picked up some coffee, some overnight oats with blueberry compote, and a savory pastry. Once I was done with that I found spot amongst some Apple engineers just in time for the keynote to start.\nAfter the keynote was lunchtime. I walked round for a bit looking at all the food options before settling on the grilled chicken with salad. I took this over to the inner meadow where there were a number of tables set up.\nI sat down randomly and started to eat and chat with others. Turned out I was sitting right next to an industrial designer on the Vision Pro, so the conversation was mostly about that.\nThen it was time for the Platforms State of the Union. At first I went to the outside area by the main stage and sat on the fabric lounge chairs, but that was bothering my back so I came back inside to sit on a sturdier chair.\nAs I watched the video, I also noticed the space, how it was full of sunlight, large indoor trees, and expansive and seamlessly transitioning from inside to outside. And every bit of it was curved. This was certainly a unique space.\nOnce that video was done, it was time for other social events. I had previously signed up for walking tours of the inner meadow and of the ring building, but that system seemed to have not worked too well for Apple as they were now just organizing all that on a first come first served basis. I got in line for the inner meadow tour.\nThe tour lasted about thirty minutes. Our first stop was by some fruit trees where a docent talked about all the fruit they grow and how it is all set up.\nThe second stop was by a shallow pond. In the center of the pond was a round plate that goes up and down. This creates a gentle wave that is imperceptible unless one is looking closely, but makes a definite wave crashing sound as it reached the edge of the pond. that was pretty cool.\nThe third and final stop was by the rainbow arches where a different docent talked about how it came to be as originally a temporary sculpture that was later made permanent. Then we made our way back on the same path.\nRight after that I got in line for the building tour. This was very popular and there was a lot of management going on to get people into small batches and move them along as tour guides returned from their previous tour and started a new one. At this point it definitely felt like I was in line for a theme park ride.\nThe ring tour took us upstairs to the third level from one side of Caffé Macs. Then to the inner side of the building, across the terrace overlooking the main event area and back down.\nAt one point a docent talked about the structure of the building. Some interesting facts:\nOuter circumference is one mile. Inner circumference is 0.75 mile. There\u0026rsquo;s a four feet quake zone all around the outside, so the whole building is capable of moving significantly in case of an earthquake. The two massive doors are the largest ever of their kind. And apparently super quiet when opening/closing. A lot of the dirt from digging up the foundation is piled up and forms the landscaping. The land is 80% greenery and 20% building. Previously it was the opposite. The roof hosts the largest solar installation on a building. The building temperature is maintained at a comfortable level by passive mechanisms most of the time. From there we walked over to an area by the campus transit center. There we descended to a lower level where a gallery space had been set up showing photos and videos from behind the scenes of a project called Mirage. There were even some samples of the cast glass made for the project.\nNext up was the Apple Design Awards event. While it is definitely a crowning achievement for the winners, it is always fun and inspiring to see all the apps that make it to the finals, and this year was no exception. There was a lot of excitement and joy in the design awards.\nFollowing the awards ceremony, was the final event of the day. It was billed as \u0026ldquo;Special Evening Activity\u0026rdquo; in the days leading up to WWDC, but it was announced earlier that it would be a visit to the Steve Jobs Theater for something related to the Vision Pro hardware. It was unclear if people would get a chance to try it out so there was suddenly a surge of people towards that direction because of course no one wanted to miss that opportunity if it presented itself. The crowd was met by a line of Apple employees that stopped the flow, while whatever final preparations were made so that we could be led there in small batches. Apparently inside the cafe were preparations for beverages and dinner, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if anyone made it to that.\nThankfully I was near the front of the crowd, so my wait was only about thirty minutes. I walked over to the theater, which was hidden from view until the very last bend in the path.\nInside the building was a display of all the new mac hardware but also a line to go downstairs. I made my way down there and into a hands-off area where a number of Vision Pro were on display to see, but not to handle.\nA few minutes later as I emerged from the theater building, I saw this lovely sunset view of the grass and the main building.\nFrom there I made my way out as that was it for the day.\nThe Evening Before the Main Event The main event was on Monday, but an early check-in gathering was organized for the evening before at Apple\u0026rsquo;s old headquarters at Infinite Loop. I arrived there at about 6pm. There were hundreds of Apple retail employees at various stations for facilitating check-ins and to greet people as they arrived and left. On check-in I received a badge and also a tote bag filled with goodies.\nThe gathering was in a courtyard-like large open area surrounded by campus buildings. There were beverages, and seating. I got a beverage and mulled about the crowd. I met a couple of people I knew from online, and a few other people that I\u0026rsquo;d not met before. I was there for less than an hour and left shortly before the event ended, to make my way to Miniboss Arcade in downtown San Jose for the RevenueCat party.\nThe Morning After the Main Event On Tuesday morning I went to an event at the Apple Developer Center, across the street from Apple Park. We were led into their Big Sur theater that seats two hundred people. There we got a live presentation about the space and how it is relevant to developers. That was followed by second presentation about developing for visionOS using RealityKit, ARKit, Reality Composer Pro, and the new simulator. It looks like Apple has put a lot of thought into making this new platform approachable by developers who currently build apps for all their existing platforms, but perhaps have no experience with developing for headsets using 3D frameworks.\nAfter the presentation we were led to a space that had beverages and food for socializing and meeting people from relevant teams at Apple. This developer center event was unexpected and I was pleasantly surprised at the thought that went into it. It was a nice culmination of my time in person at WWDC.\nMy heartiest gratitude to the people of Apple for their hospitality ❤️\n","date":"2023-06-12","dateFormatted":"June 12, 2023","excerpt":"\nLast week I went to Cupertino for Apple’s Special Event at Apple Park.\nThe Main Event The announcements at the event and the hot takes around it have gone around the internet, and the world, perhaps …","image":"https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/912dcff903.jpg","title":"📷 WWDC at Apple Park","url":"/2023/06/12/wwdc-at-apple.html","year":"2023"},{"content":"Saturday morning vibes at the dining table.\n","date":"2023-06-10","dateFormatted":"June 10, 2023","excerpt":"Saturday morning vibes at the dining table.\n","image":"https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/d06a93ae92.jpg","title":"Saturday morning vibes at the dining table.\n","url":"/2023/06/10/saturday-morning-vibes.html","year":"2023"},{"content":"\nSunset over Apple Park, as seen from the Steve Jobs Theater. 5th June, 2023.\nMy heartiest gratitude to the people of Apple for their hospitality ❤️\n","date":"2023-06-07","dateFormatted":"June 7, 2023","excerpt":"\nSunset over Apple Park, as seen from the Steve Jobs Theater. 5th June, 2023.\nMy heartiest gratitude to the people of Apple for their hospitality ❤️\n","image":"https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2023/9f9fee0637.jpg","title":"\nSunset over Apple Park, as seen from the Steve Jobs Theater. 5th June, 2023.\nMy heartiest gratitude to the people of Apple for their hospitality ❤️\n","url":"/2023/06/07/sunset-over-apple.html","year":"2023"},{"content":"Less than 24 hours left for my flight to California.

A few weeks ago, a board on the top step cracked on the edge. I added some blue tape to make it more visible until I got around to fixing it.\nSoon thereafter I started working on a plan to fix it. The simplest thing would be to replace the board but many other boards are also not in good shape, so a fresh set would be best, especially since I may be getting some painting work done and a fresh coat on this could be added to that. Once I decided to go with that I felt like I had to address the fact that the treads are held up by two stringers, and there really ought to be three. This was starting to feel like yak shaving but I hadn\u0026rsquo;t taken on a project like this in a while and it was appealing to spend the time to do it right.\nSo my plan was to remove the treads, measure out a new stringer to go in the middle, cut it out of a 2x12, attach it and then put a whole bunch of fresh boards, probably also adding risers. After talking to friends and looking at some videos it seemed like reasonable idea.\nYesterday I got to it. First I removed the treads. I noticed that the bottom of one stringer had a crack and was about to come apart. I drove a couple of screws to reattach it. This was the first new issue I noticed. I also noticed that each stringer was resting differently, the concrete seems to go around one, but under the other. That was the second new issue.\nAfter removing the treads I measured out the stringers and this is what those measurements were like. As you can see, there is not much consistency between the two, including the fact that the first step from the ground was not only wildly higher than the others, it is also well over the building code. These were the third and fourth new issues.\nNevertheless I figured out measurements and marked it on the board but that didn\u0026rsquo;t look right. I did it again. Something was still off. I looked at the stringers closely and noticed a fifth new issue.\nFor whatever reason the builder had removed extra material from each corner of each stringer so the angles weren\u0026rsquo;t square. That was the last straw. At that point I decided that there were too many issues with leaving the existing structure intact and that the more reasonable thing would be to just rebuild the steps from scratch.\nI put the treads back while moving the cracked board to the bottom tread so it was out of the way where it would cause any harm. I also cleaned it up a bit and applied wood glue for good measure. All of this is a temporary measure until these can be rebuilt either by me, or by someone I hire. Will report back after that!\n","date":"2023-05-30","dateFormatted":"May 30, 2023","excerpt":"Our house has five steps to get down to the backyard.

For outdoor activities, the watch records location data throughout the activity. This is later shown on a map in the Fitness app on the iPhone. While that map is interactive, exporting it only exports a low resolution image, and not the actual route.\nWhen I share an activity on a blog post I like to show the map but I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of just sharing an image of the map. I would like to get the actual data out so that it can be overlaid on an interactive map using various mapping tools.\nI found an app on the App Store that can export the data, among many other features, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t keen on paying a subscription for this one small occasional use case. As an app developer, I know that access to this data is controlled by the Health related privacy settings on the iPhone and is accessible using the HealthKit framework. So I decided make a small app to get this data out while also gaining familiarity with that part of the iOS SDK. A few weeks ago I got started on it. I worked on it in small chunks of time, as I usually do with such side projects. The UI came together pretty quickly as a SwiftUI app. It is nothing special but looks presentable and gets the job done.\nIt took just a little bit longer to get the data out from HealthKit. Converting it to GPX files was straightforward. Once I had created a file I could use the share sheet to get it into other apps or to simply save it. From there it can be imported into tools that put it on a map.\nFor example, here\u0026rsquo;s a GPX file of a walk at Mount Tabor Park. It can be utilized to create an embedded map as shown below.\nSee full screen\nOr even into Google Maps. In fact once imported there, you can view the track with elevation by selecting the option for Google Earth and enabling the 3D view. I love this option as it adds another dimension (literally 😂) to the activity.\nBoth these presentation styles are far more interesting to me than just a low resolution image out of the Fitness app.\n","date":"2023-03-12","dateFormatted":"March 12, 2023","excerpt":"I use an Apple Watch to track my activities, whether that be workouts or recreational.

I thought that was cool and it introduced me to several hardware and software tools that I had not known about. I wanted to set this up at my home so I filed a project for a later date.\nWell, that day arrived a few weeks ago and here\u0026rsquo;s what it looks like today:\nTo get started exploring this I purchased an AcuRite bundle of three sensor towers and one display. I set up the towers around my home and put the display in my home office. It was neat to see the display showing the measurements at any given time. Soon I wanted to go to the next level and record and see the data over time.\nThese sensors broadcast the data over 433 MHz and there are consumer level antennas and software available to read this data. I bought a NooElec bundle which gave me all the hardware I needed to receive this data on my computer. Setting it up was straightforward. I used rtl_433 and was able to start seeing the wireless data immediately in the terminal on my Mac.\nThe next step was storing all this data. That\u0026rsquo;s where influxdb came in. And the glue to get it from rtl_433 to influxdb involved MQTT and telegraf.\nThere was a lot of trial and error but I finally got it all set up and was able to get the data into influxdb. I even made a dashboard in there to visualize it. The options on that dashboard were limited so I got grafana set up and built a dashboard in that which can be seen at the top of this post as seen on my desktop browser. It also looks great on mobile devices.\nExcept for rtl_433, the rest of the tools all run on docker on my desktop Mac. At some point I may migrate that off to a Raspberry Pi but for now it\u0026rsquo;s all working and I\u0026rsquo;m going to take a break from any further optimizing/tweaking for now.\nUpdate (6th March, 2023): Follow up post about expanding on this effort.\n","date":"2023-03-01","dateFormatted":"March 1, 2023","excerpt":"Sometime last year my friend Andrew made me aware of the sensors and software he was using to monitor temperature and humidity in his home.

It\u0026rsquo;s definitely the end of an era.\nAfter reading it, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but clarify a few things about the origin story 😬\nQuoting from the article,\nFor a town that has been less than welcoming to Walmart, it may be a bit of head-scratcher how they wound up with a regional technology office here. The answer, like so many other regional offices in town, is through acquisition.\nAcquisition, yes, but not the one of Small Society as the article alludes.\nIn April 2011, Walmart Labs acquired Set Direction which had been building the Walmart iOS app, and more. At the time Set Direction had one employee WFH in Portland. Next month I joined the team.\nA short while later we hired a third person and rented a conference room at Collective Agency\u0026rsquo;s first location in NW Portland. When our team expanded to five people over a couple more months, we moved into the first proper Walmart Labs office at One Main Place in November 2011. During that time we built and released the first few versions of the native iOS SDK based Walmart app.\nQuoting again from the article,\nAfter being acquired in 2012, Small Society took on the moniker of Walmart Labs, serving as a regional technology office for the retail giant and continued to be a presence — albeit a much quieter presence — within the local startup community, even taking up residence in coworking spaces around town.\nWalmart Labs existed in Portland for the better part of a year before the Small Society acquisition in January 2012. And while Walmart Labs worked out of a coworking space for a few months, Small Society (as part of Walmart Labs) never did. After the acquisition they continued to operate from their existing office.\nFor eight months Walmart Labs was split across two offices until we all moved into the space above the erstwhile Rock Bottom Brewery (2nd and Morrison) in September 2012.\nEdited to clarify: During recent years Walmart Labs did move into a coworking space but that was long after all the original people had moved on.\n","date":"2023-02-14","dateFormatted":"February 14, 2023","excerpt":"Today I came across this Silicon Florist article about the closing of the Walmart office in Portland.

Mackye Gruber\nSome thoughts on these results:\nMost of the films here are from the last twenty-five years. Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz are the two remarkable exceptions, surprisingly from the same year, 1939, and with the same main director, Victor Fleming. Gone with the Wind has a runtime of 238 minutes, which is far above any other film here, and that makes it additionally remarkable that it is on this list. Everything Everywhere All at Once was a surprise to see here, given its newness. I wonder if its rating will go up or down with time. I have seen seventeen of these films. The others are now on my to-watch list 😄 Notes on the data filtering and sorting process to get to the final list:\nOnly movies. This eliminated shorts, TV, etc. Not animated. Apparently it is common for animated movies to have more than one director, so they were sort of skewing the results away from what I really intended to discover, even though I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize it at the time I asked myself that leading question. High rating (\u0026gt; 7.5) and high number of votes (\u0026gt; 250000). I tweaked these to narrow down a short list. If I only maximized one or the other, the results didn\u0026rsquo;t seem representative of the question. Year of release used as a tie breaker. I figured a more recent film with a high rating had a larger impact on the zeitgeist and so deserved to be higher on the list. The script can be found here.\nP.S. The dataset obviously has biases and those impact the results.\n","date":"2022-12-29","dateFormatted":"December 29, 2022","excerpt":"I was playing with the pandas library on python and picked the IMDb dataset to explore.\nTo give myself a learning goal, I asked the following question:\nWhat movies are generally regarded as the best …","image":"","title":"Playing with the IMDb dataset to find top movies that have multiple directors","url":"/2022/12/29/playing-with-the.html","year":"2022"},{"content":"I love the way Mythic Quest does the one flashback episode each season.

This was especially delightful. The primary stone in the construction is Makrana marble, which is famous for being strong and translucent.\nThe center of the main gate\u0026rsquo;s arch is perfectly aligned with the center of the main arch of the Taj Mahal, and both are perfectly aligned due North. Our guide, Tarun, made us aware of this and challenged us to check using the phone\u0026rsquo;s compass, which I did!\nWe walked the charbagh garden pathways, and made our way as Tarun took some photos of us all the while sharing the story of the Taj.\nThe work to cut stones and inlay them is very intricate and labor intensive and there’s a large industry that continues to do this work, the knowledge of which has been passed down for generations since the time of the Taj’s construction.\nInside the mausoleum, photography is prohibited, and the outer rooms are cordoned off. The replica of the graves of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan lie in the center, and one can walk around that in a designated path. The actual graves are in the basement underneath but that is inaccessible to the public. This is the original design.\nA man with a small flashlight demonstrated how the stones in the inlaid flowers glow when light is applied on them. It is really a wonderful effect, and one that I don’t recall seeing on previous trips. This same man asked for our names by turn and said it out loud as he looked upwards, to sound an echo.\nAfter walking around the inside, we made our way to the outside on the provided path. As we did so, the light of the setting sun made lovely patterns as it made its way in through the carved and perforated marble walls.\nEven a Tuesday afternoon brought a lot of visitors.\nAs we made our way back to the exit by the main gate, the Sun set completely and so the Taj appeared a cool white, which was very different from the vibrant yellow and orange it had been in the hours before. I’m pretty sure that previously I had only visited in mid-day so hadn’t seen this effect. Experiencing these changing colors on the Taj was my favorite thing about this visit, which was my third or fourth.\nMaybe someday I\u0026rsquo;ll even see the famous full-moon-lit shade of Taj.\nUpload images using Mimi.\n","date":"2022-12-23","dateFormatted":"December 23, 2022","excerpt":"In the last week of our recent trip to India, Jenni and I went on an overnight trip from New Delhi to Agra to visit the Taj Mahal.\nWe arrived at the site a couple hours before sunset so the Sun was …","image":"https://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2022/6f0d12ec4c.jpg","title":"📷 Shades of Taj","url":"/2022/12/23/shades-of-taj.html","year":"2022"},{"content":"Home office humidity is down to 18%.

It has been an annual camping destination for Jenni\u0026rsquo;s family for decades. This month was my first time there. We spent three nights at the campground there and had a wonderful time exploring the park and especially hiking up the rock.\nThe weather forecast had said that there may be thunderstorms with lightning the morning we were thinking of hiking up, but fortunately that warning moved to later in the day, so we got going a little before 10am.\nThere was a short trail that started right outside the campground and took us to the foot of the rock in a few minutes. This was a mostly flat, or a very gentle climb. There were five of us humans, and one very happy dog.\nAs we got closer the features of the rock became more discernible. The trail led us to the central part of the rock, to the start of the switchbacks that went up. Other trails lead there as well. Shortly before that was a picnic table, which seemed ideal for a pre/post hike snack.\nThese initial switchbacks are a mix of loose rocks and gravel, or just rock. It was the trickiest part of the hike and lasted maybe a quarter mile, with a moderate to steep slope.\nOnce we were above that part, the view expanded and we had two options on the trail. We could\u0026rsquo;ve gone right followed by a right-loop, or we could\u0026rsquo;ve gone left, and done a left-loop. That day we went right.\nThere was still more elevation to be gained for about a quarter mile before we reached the top of the rock. At this point we started the loop which went for a while along the edge. This afforded lovely views, starting with the campground area, followed by more expansive views of the lake, with rocky islands spotting it all over.\nAfter about twenty minutes of hiking and stopping to admire views, we came to the farthest point on the loop and the trail turned away from the edge. The return path was through grassy fields. To start, on our right there was a short slope to a lower elevation of a large field. In the distance we could see to the end of the rock plateau, then a gap and another large rock or hill beyond that.\nA short while of hiking on the plateau, with some gentle ups and down slopes, got us back to the start of the loop. Not much to see except a dramatic sky above and grassy fields on either side with a small variety of wildflowers.\nWe made our way back to the fork in the middle of the rock, descended the switchbacks, and soon found ourselves on the last stretch of the trail.\nAt this point the sky was very dramatic.

Often some would just stay on the stove and need to be moved out of the way when cooking. Whenever I would see pans hanging, in person or in a photo, it seemed like the best solution. We had space on only one wall in the kitchen, so that decision was easy.\nPans can be heavy and our walls are lathe and plaster, so mounting just about anywhere was out of the question. And so the construction method was narrowed down to boards mounted to studs, with hardware to hang the pans.\nWe went to the amazing local woodworking store where they have finished dimensional lumber and narrowed down our choice based primarily on cost. We wanted a dark color, and I already had dark walnut stain from the mail and keys organizer I made a while back.\nBack home, I cut the boards to length. We wanted a tight fit and the two ends, door frame and wall, weren\u0026rsquo;t super plumb so there were a lot of measurements and dry fitting before we had a set of boards that were just right. It was time to apply the stain and let it rest.\nAfter that it was a straightforward process of screwing in the boards to the studs while using a couple of small blocks to space them evenly.\nOnce that was done, we installed a couple of IKEA rails that we had and the rack was ready to use. In the days that followed we sourced some nice hooks and Jenni put up a couple of planters and some homegrown produce.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been over a year and this has totally been worth it. I highly recommend utilizing vertical space in the kitchen where you can.\nP.S. This blog post should\u0026rsquo;ve been written about a year ago.

It is also the one that is used by visitors. It has never had a good place to put stuff. The sink doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough room on it for anything besides the soap, and there is no vanity cabinet in which to put things. We decided a long time ago that there needed to be something.\nIt is a small room, so the only real option was a wall, and this was pretty much the only place to mount something like this on the wall in a manner that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t in the way, or in an awkward spot.\nAt some point I came across this video and realized that this design could work well. The main constraint as shown in the video was depth. This was also the case in our bathroom so as to not interfere with the shower door next to it. A secondary constraint was the light switches but that was straightforward to design around. Also, unlike that video, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t drill the sides into a wall because there is just trim board on one side and stone tiles on the other. So I made some adjustments to adapt that design to our needs.\nAnd so many months ago I got the materials. Then something or the other delayed the project but a couple months ago I finally started on it. And in small increments I built it up. A few weeks ago and after some mistakes and corrections, I finally applied paint and finish, and mounted it.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it looks in perspective with a wide angle lens.\nP.S. The video I linked is from the Darbin Orvar channel, of which I\u0026rsquo;m a fan, and have followed for many years.

A bed in that region of our yard did a lot better than our existing beds, especially for tomatoes, so we decided that we would build a new one next to it in 2020.\nWell, last weekend we built that new gardening bed. It\u0026rsquo;s the end of the main vegetable growing season but it is also the time to plant garlic. The ones from last year came out great. Apparently you should rotate the bed you use for garlic, so that became the impetus to get the new one set up.\nI\u0026rsquo;d bought some 4x4 lumber almost two months ago for this. Some weeks ago I\u0026rsquo;d cut ten pieces down to half with my Japanese pull saw. I love that saw. It makes cutting thick lumber pretty much effortless.\nWe went to our local gardening store and bought 14 bags of 3 cubic feet of raised bed potting mix. Borrowing a truck from my friend made that easy. Oh and it was fun to drive a stick shift after a long time.\nWe cleared the space next to the previous bed, leveled it, laid down the fabric and finalized the location.\nThen came the part of assembling the structure. I had used 6\u0026quot; construction lag screws, with a 5/16\u0026quot; shaft last time. So I went and bought more. The ones I bought this time were a bit different and proved to be a little harder to use. After some trial and error, the final process involved pre-drilling with a long 3/16\u0026quot; bit and screwing in the lag screw after that. Here\u0026rsquo;s a comparison of the two screws. The one on the left is the new one.\nHaving resolved that we built up all the layers for the structure.\nThe final step was loading all the dirt which went by a lot faster with bags than it did with shoveling a pile last year.\nSome slo-mo fun was had too!\nA couple of days later Jenni planted all the garlic. So we\u0026rsquo;re good to go and expecting a bunch in June 2021!\n","date":"2020-10-24","dateFormatted":"October 24, 2020","excerpt":"Last year we built a gardening bed in the spring and used it for summer vegetables and for garlic over the winter.

Mostly out of technological curiosity, and sure, a little bit out of a need for convenience. We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have a doorbell, so people visiting or leaving packages would simply knock on the door which was easy to miss.\nAt the same time, the prominent products made by large tech companies constantly stream video data from a doorbell to their servers for analysis and trade. That wasn\u0026rsquo;t something I wanted. So I was on the lookout for a product that would keep the video data local to my home network. It would still send data over the internet to my device if I wanted to access it, or respond to a doorbell ring, but it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be sending significant amounts of data that is of no value to me but has value to the surveillance industry.\nThankfully, I have a bit of knowledge on tech stuff, so I can setup and manage a home network. I have wired ethernet cables in my house, and have slowly upgraded my network to use more advanced networking equipment made by Ubiquiti, rather than the stock WiFi enabled router provided by my ISP. It was with this in mind that I learned the Ubiquiti had recently launched a video doorbell in their UniFi line, which is what I use for my home networking equipment. Once I got a chance to place an order, I did, and sure enough the doorbell arrived a few days later. That was the easy part.\nNow, as I mentioned, we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a doorbell, so we didn\u0026rsquo;t even have wiring for it. I did some research, and figured out how I wanted to wire it. It\u0026rsquo;s a low voltage circuit that requires a step-down AC transformer. Normally that is attached to the wiring directly at a box in an inaccessible area, but I found a solution where I could access a wall outlet and so wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to drill into a wall or floor. A friend had a plug-in transformer that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t using, so all I needed was some wire, which I ordered. I also ordered a mechanical chime that would ring when the doorbell was pressed. I drew this rough sketch of how I imagined it getting wired.\nAt this point I set up a circuit on my desk and wired everything up. First it was just the doorbell which was easy to start and setup. Then I wired in the chime and tested that everything worked fine, which it did 🎉\nI was able to use an existing wire path for part of the way from the outlet to the door, so I got going by pulling wire through that. I drilled a hole next to the door, ran the wire through and installed the doorbell. Once again I tested that it was working fine. Next I installed the chime on the wall above the door on the inside and connected it to the circuit. And that was it for the wiring. Everything worked well. The doorbell had a good signal. This is what it looked like.\nNow all I had to do was to clean up and conceal the wiring. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything for this so I researched some more and ordered some cable concealing strips. Once those arrived I set about cutting pieces to length and enclosed much of the wire by the door with it. I also hid some of the wiring in the moulding along which I had run it. That was handy and probably cut my concealing cost in half.\nSo far the experience has been nice. There\u0026rsquo;s still issues with the integration of the app. The notification always fires when the doorbell rings, but live video and audio can be cut off some times. These are software issues and I hope they get resolved soon. A new app update came out while I was writing this post and that greatly improved the performance of showing video right after launching the app. It\u0026rsquo;s good to know they are making improvements like I had hoped.\nIn these pandemic days it\u0026rsquo;s mostly just package delivery people coming by and I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that only about half of them ring the doorbell. There have been no times when I\u0026rsquo;ve needed to talk to someone. I\u0026rsquo;m still dialing in the right motion triggers and sensitivity so I can minimize the false positives. Once that is the case I may even enable notifications for all motion events, if needed. There have been one or two cases when the delivery person delivered something on the porch and didn\u0026rsquo;t trigger the motion sensing. Hopefully those will get ironed out. I can still see those because I\u0026rsquo;ve set things up to record all video on a buffer that lasts several days. The interface for recorded video is great and makes it really easy to look at relevant events which get logged.\nOverall I\u0026rsquo;m pretty happy with it. It was an interesting project where I tackled and solved problems that were new-to-me and that\u0026rsquo;s always the best part.\nImages uploaded using Mimi.\n","date":"2020-10-19","dateFormatted":"October 19, 2020","excerpt":"\nI’ve been intrigued by the idea of a video doorbell for some time now.

St. Helens and Mt. Rainier in the distance.\nJenni at a point on the trail.\nMt. Hood, as seen from St John\u0026rsquo;s Bridge.

I\u0026rsquo;m working on an update that takes a fresh approach to the photo selection flow by utilizing new features coming in iOS 14.\niOS 14 has a powerful new system provided photo picker that lets users pick photos from their library. The new picker has great features for browsing, searching, making multiple selections, etc. This is perfect for apps like Mimi where people can pick the photos they want to upload with minimum friction and with an experience that feels true to iOS. I\u0026rsquo;m very conscious of privacy in apps, so it gives me great joy to note that with this new picker Mimi will no longer need to ask for Photos permission.\nI had planned to enhance the original photo selection screen with new features for better selection, but now I can utilize that time towards other features that folks have requested. Features that I think will be a lot more useful in the long term, like support for the share sheet, and drag and drop, that allows sending photos into Mimi from other apps. And I have more ideas that I hope to share after this initial set of work is complete.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t wait to bring this new experience to you sometime after iOS 14 launches this Fall. I appreciate your support and comments. If you\u0026rsquo;ve liked using Mimi, I\u0026rsquo;d love it if you could give it a rating or review on the App Store.

In these days of the pandemic, their adoption process has changed and you\u0026rsquo;re only allowed to apply online. So we checked their website regularly. That\u0026rsquo;s when we noticed that demand is very high these days so the window to apply was very short. New kittens would get posted but by the time we noticed and applied, they would already have been spoken for. This went on for a week or so.\nSo I did what any programmer might do, I implemented a script to detect when new kittens are posted. It was run every five minutes for about three weeks. Now it has been retired with the arrival of Mr. Momo a few weeks ago.\nThe script flow is pretty straightforward:\nRetrieve the page that lists kittens. Use some regular expressions to get the relevant data out. Open a local JSON file of saved kittens from the previous run so that the new kittens can be identified. If there are new kittens, use Pushcut to send a notification to my phone (and watch). If the notification is successful, save the list of currently available kittens in a local JSON file for referencing in the next run. It was loaded as a launchd service on my always-on Mac, which I manage using LaunchControl.app.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the script in its entirety:\n😻\n","date":"2020-08-19","dateFormatted":"August 19, 2020","excerpt":"We wanted to adopt a kitten from the Oregon Humane Society.

His passing was sudden and unexpected. It has shaken up our entire family across two vast countries. He was only 48. Now he will forever be 48.\nTechnically he was my cousin, but we grew up under the same roof in New Delhi, our mothers cooked side by side in the same kitchen, we ate at the same table. I shared his room for a while in the 80s, as our growing joint family was on the verge of becoming a nuclear one. He was my brother.\nHe was funny, full of life, and shared the joy of it at all occasions. He achieved tremendous success in his career, and would\u0026rsquo;ve reached higher had he had the time. As we grew older, we grew apart, but only in distance, as we pursued our lives and dreams. I would only see him every few years. Those times were always wonderful. So it was a joy when he moved to the US in 2017 as I managed to see him more often then. I am grateful for that.\nHis passing was not as a result of COVID-19, but that has certainly impacted all related events since then, including my inability to attend his funeral in person. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t manage it. Others in our family managed it and showed up to support his grieving wife and daughter.\nI attended his funeral service via a video call. There were about 25 people present in person, masked and social distanced as best as could be managed. A few hundred people were on the call. If that number feels large, know that far more would have shown up in person if this vile event had happened in better times, and at the place he had called home for twenty years. Over the last couple of weeks I\u0026rsquo;ve heard several stories of his friendships, generosities and kindnesses. He was beloved by many.\nOur family has set up an online memorial site. If you knew him, I encourage you to share something there if you like.\nAs someone said, he lives amongst the stars now.

Now I\u0026rsquo;d heard of such a use before but this time I had a trackpad lying around. I\u0026rsquo;d gotten it with my Mac instead of a mouse because I already had a mouse, but had stashed it away. So I got it out and set it up for my left hand.\nA month passed. I was using it rarely. One day the battery in my mouse ran out in the middle of the workday, so I plugged it in and moved the trackpad over to the right side.\nA day passed, and the mouse had long been charged, so I unplugged it, but for whatever reason I kept using the trackpad.\nA week passed and I realized that I was liking the trackpad a lot more than the mouse. So I put the mouse in the closet.\nNow two months have passed and I can\u0026rsquo;t think of going back. The gestures are intuitive and I\u0026rsquo;ve found several operations to be a lot smoother.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a happy Magic Trackpad 2 user 😊.\n","date":"2020-05-14","dateFormatted":"May 14, 2020","excerpt":"About three months ago I heard of someone using a trackpad with their non-dominant hand at their Mac.

I also saved this file so I can just update it in the future as I read books. Another reason I went through this step was because I was having a hard time parsing the original CSV file using the script I wrote. Export the spreadsheet file as CSV.

And each time after I complete that, I take a photo of the readout.\nThis morning I took one with my new iPhone 11 Pro and got the following photo.\nAs you can see, parts of the readout were invisible or clipped. I think it is because the speed of the default camera app in those conditions is just too fast in comparison to the refresh rates on that LED readout. The cameras can go really fast with shutter speeds, but there’s a lot of computational photography involved, so the final composite shutter speed may vary.\nLuckily I noticed this right away, and decided to use the new “night mode” feature which allows you to effectively slow down the shutter speed while maintaining stability. And that got me the following photo.\nPhew! This is readable.\nP.S.

I bought it on eBay as a new but opened product. It’s been great. I had two of the drives in a RAID 0 configuration (for higher bandwidth single volume) and they were serving as the primary storage of about 1 TB of photos.\nRecently I decided to partially upgrade that setup by purchasing a Crucial 2 TB SSD. In order to install it I also had to purchase a OWC Spare Drive Tray since the ones in my Thunderbay didn’t have the right setup for 2.5” drives. That took a few days to arrive. In the meantime I installed the SSD into an old USB LaCie enclosure and moved my files over to it.\nI decided to measure the drive performance as I went through this process. And for that I used Blackmagic Disk Speed Test which is available for free on the Mac App Store.\nEach disk in my original setup had about 190 MB/s read/write speed.\nThe RAID 0 gave me about 300-320 MB/s. I forgot to speed test it before I removed it, but that’s what I recall from back when I first set it up.\nIn the intermediate setup with the LaCie enclosure I got about 250 MB/s write and 270 MB/s read speed.\nOnce the drive tray arrived, I moved the SSD over to that and into the Thunderbay for the final setup where I’m now getting about 350 MB/s write and about 380 MB/s read speed.\nI may be able to extract some more performance from this SSD by making some other purchases and changes, but I don’t feel compelled to do that at this time. This is better than what I had, and quite acceptable for my use. In fact I felt totally comfortable moving my iCloud Photo library over to it as well. This freed up about a third of my internal drive storage.\nI could’ve done this sooner but the tradeoff of storage size vs. price didn’t seem worth it. In the future I may keep an eye on the price of such drives and pick up at sale to upgrade more of my Thunderbay drives.\nAnd in the foolhardy-comparison-department, here’s the crazy fast speed on the internal SSD on my iMac (Retina 5K, 27”, 2017 model).\n","date":"2019-08-22","dateFormatted":"August 22, 2019","excerpt":"I’ve been using a OWC Thunderbay 4 (Thunderbolt 2) external enclosure with four 3 TB hard disk drives for the last two years.

Then came surgery, recovery, return of ability, and progression from there on. Yesterday I hiked up Dog Mountain. It was the most strenuous hike I\u0026rsquo;ve ever done. And as I sit here all sore the next day, I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly grateful to be able to do that.\nDue to it\u0026rsquo;s incredible popularity, and limited parking, the Forest Service has been issuing permits for weekend days. Jenni bought ours a while ago, and we have been making small preparations ever since. Purchasing some gear (backpack, water reservoir, hiking poles), and going on light to moderate hikes starting in early Spring. Although we didn\u0026rsquo;t go on any hike for over a month before this, and that was a mistake.\nWe arrived at the trailhead just before 9:30am, met up with our friends, and started the hike a few minutes later. About half a mile up is a \u0026ldquo;difficulty fork\u0026rdquo; 😂\nFor the first 2.5 to 3 miles the trail is like many others in the Gorge, comprising of switchbacks through the woods.\nHalfway to the top the trail emerged from the forest briefly for a sweeping vista of the river and the gorge.\nFor the last half mile going up, we were out of the trees and surrounded by wildflowers. It was here that the wind also picked up significantly. This final stretch afforded gorgeous view all the way, with our trail surrounded by steep slopes full of wildflowers.\nThe views at the summit were incredible. Some fast moving clouds engulfed us soon after we arrived. That was quite a show before it cleared up in a few minutes. It was time to put on another layer. We sat there and enjoyed the views as we had lunch comprising of tasty sandwiches that Jenni had made, and some chips.\nAs we started back down, my IT band was hurting on the outer side of each of my knees. I was annoyed at myself for not having taken the time to go on hikes and do regular stretches since the Coyote Wall hike from over a month ago. Every downward step was painful. Soon Jenni reminded me of the cross-leg stretches and those helped. Those and the hiking poles were incredibly helpful in making the descent.\nHeading back down we reentered the forest, and it sheltered us from the sun and wind for the rest of the way.\nAll in all this was a great hike with friends, and brought tremendous satisfaction on a personal level. It is entirely possible that someday my back may go bad again, but I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that I can do this today, and motivated to keep it this way. I\u0026rsquo;m also grateful for Jenni who has been supportive and encouraging all along the way ❤️\nActivity stats: Distance: 7 miles (11.27 km)\nElevation Gain: 2800 ft (853m)\nAscent/Descent: 800 ft/mile (75.76 m/km)\nTime (including breaks): 5h 30m\n","date":"2019-06-09","dateFormatted":"June 9, 2019","excerpt":"\nTwo and a half years ago, my lower back had gotten so bad that I couldn’t walk for more than a few minutes at a time without having to stop to sit or squat.

It couldn\u0026rsquo;t handle our lifestyle, by which I mean, hold a bunch of mail of varying sizes for a bunch of days. Oh, and some keys and the super long IKEA shoehorn (the best!).\nI began to dream up a new replacement as a woodworking project. I made a Pinterest board to get some design inspiration. Then one day I just sat down and sketched it out using GoodNotes on my iPad Pro using an Apple Pencil.\nI\u0026rsquo;d imagined that the plywood would be 1/2\u0026quot; thick, but after some discussion with Jenni, we decided to go for the chonk look that was distinctive of the tabletop shelf/box I made a couple of months ago. This lowered the costs as well since I already had enough scraps of the baltic birch plywood. All I needed was the dark walnut stain, a birch dowel, and hanging hardware. The mail holders are held together by glue, and attached to the back by screws drilled in from behind. The pegs are held in by glue. There were a couple other changes as evident from the sketch and the photo of the final piece.\nThe groove detail in the pegs was Jenni\u0026rsquo;s idea. I tried a couple of ways to cut it out and landed upon just keeping the table saw blade low and using my crosscut sled to spin the dowel in place over the blade. That worked wonderfully!\nI finished the build a few weeks ago but the hardware I bought to hang it didn\u0026rsquo;t work well. Then other things took up some time so I finally procured some new hardware and hung it up this week. We\u0026rsquo;re both very happy with how it turned out.\nAnd in parting, here\u0026rsquo;s a photo of the old organizer trying hard to keep up.\n","date":"2019-05-25","dateFormatted":"May 25, 2019","excerpt":"\nThe mail and keys organizer located just inside our home entrance had to go.

I like it for a lot of reasons, and it\u0026rsquo;s working out great. So far I\u0026rsquo;ve been using it as a plain old journal, where you write what\u0026rsquo;s on your mind. Recently, I decided that I wanted to get my digital history into it as well. One of the first things that came to mind was my Foursquare/Swarm checkin history which goes back to 2009. I decided to start there.\nI exported all my data and wrote a script in Python to extract what I needed from it to make journal entries. The two relevant files were checkins.json and photos.json. You can get my script on Github by selecting here if you\u0026rsquo;d like to use it, or dig into it. It should also appear embedded at the end of this post. First the script pre-processes the data to get all the photos attached to checkins. Then it goes over the checkin history to extract most of what I want, but since the exported data doesn\u0026rsquo;t include venue coordinates, it has to do a little more.\nIt makes calls to the Foursquare API to fetch the venue coordinates for each checkin. Then it puts everything together and makes the actual entry using Day One\u0026rsquo;s command line utility. I had several thousand entries but the free plan for the API has a daily limit of 500 calls, so I manually ran it a few times over the course of a couple of weeks until they\u0026rsquo;d all been imported. I could\u0026rsquo;ve automated that but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t keen on spending the time on that.\nDay One does allow one to link it to IFTTT so that all new checkins get logged automatically, and I enabled that a while back, but I\u0026rsquo;ve not been happy with that integration. Now that I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with the flow of data, I plan to create new entries every couple of months or so, perhaps with a new script that works entirely with the API.\nI\u0026rsquo;d love to hear if you have automated any journaling as I\u0026rsquo;m keen to explore other ways of doing so myself.\n","date":"2019-04-16","dateFormatted":"April 16, 2019","excerpt":"I’ve been journaling in Day One for some time now.

Setapp is an app subscription service for macOS where you sign up for $10 a month to gain full access to a catalog of over 100 apps.\nThis is not a review of Setapp, but rather my initial experience with it after having heard about it a few times on the Mac Power Users podcast. Many of apps in the Setapp catalog are well known and as such I was already aware of them. But there are several that are new to me.\nApps that I found myself using often during the trial:\nMarked Mindnode Flume Timing iStat Menus Apps I installed and use occasionally and would expect to use occasionally in the future:\nWiFi Explorer World Clock Pro Apps I tried but then uninstalled after using just one or two times:\nCleanMyMac X IconJar Luminar Flex Apps that are included in Setapp but which I\u0026rsquo;ve previously bought individually and use anyway:\nScreens Paw Sip So with a very rough mental calculation I think the math would work out alright. Of course the main hook/promise of Setapp is the potential of all the other apps. Many may not be relevant today but may become relevant tomorrow. Their stated goal:\nWe have 100+ apps in the stack and are steadily adding more of them to cover all of your main needs. Eventually, Setapp is to deliver about 300 Mac apps, all per a single $9.99 fee (+ taxes).\nI have already identified some apps that I plan to use soon but just didn\u0026rsquo;t have a chance to use during the trial period.

That\u0026rsquo;s how this came to be.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a beginner woodworker and always on the lookout for new projects that I can use as an excuse to learn new skills, and let\u0026rsquo;s be honest, to buy new tools. For this project I ended up buying a new blade for my table saw. One that has teeth with flat tips to make a flat cut, so that the finger joints fit snugly.\nI also made a new tool, or as they call it in woodworking, a jig. I made a crosscut sled for my table saw, and that was very useful in making the 232 cuts for the finger joints on this box. That required some patience since you have to set things up correctly, make sure the sides are properly aligned, and not make adjustments until you\u0026rsquo;ve made all the cuts. I used some scraps to make a few joints, and messed that up a bit, but that led to this working out fine. Although at one point I dropped one of the sides and broke a couple of the end finger joints on it. I made sure they were on the back when I put it all together. 😉\nJenni picked the interior color. The paint company called it Salmon. I constructed the whole box before applying paint, so that step was a little awkward, but it turned out alright. Lesson learned, I think. We decided to keep the plywood edges showing, so I ended up finishing those, and the exterior, with some clear satin polyurethane. Oh, the material was baltic birch plywood, which as you can see has a lot of layers.\nMany parts of this were great learning experiences. Not all joints came out equally well but they were acceptable. Making the crosscut sled took longer than making this box but it was totally worth it. I\u0026rsquo;d been wanting to make one for a while and I look forward to using it for many projects to come.\n","date":"2019-03-25","dateFormatted":"March 25, 2019","excerpt":"\nJenni wanted a shelf in the kitchen to organize things a little better and I wanted to make different kinds of boxes.

I ordered a cup of pourover coffee named Burundi Buziraguhindwa. The menu described it as “natural sundried, juicy, strawberry, raspberry”. Turned out to be one of the best coffees I’ve ever had. It was the catalyst, because a few minutes later I had made the decision. When I told Jenni about it, she started calling it “magic coffee”. I love her.\nFast forward to August. My cross country road trip has ended, and I’m back in Portland. I’ve been talking to friends about buying a house, and looking for an agent. Amber recommends Laurie Gilmer. I meet Laurie and the house search begins. Two weeks later I make my first offer. She suggests I write a “love letter”, so I do. It doesn’t work out.\nAbout two months pass. I see a bunch of houses. I make an offer. It doesn’t work out. Four days later I make one more offer. It doesn’t work out. The love letter is getting better all the time, I think.\nAnother month passes. Another offer. I really wanted that one. Nopes. Two months pass. I see a bunch more houses. Another offer. I really really wanted that one. Same story.\nWith every offer I got sleepless nights and elevated stress. Prices of houses in Portland have gone up by 12% over the last year. That trend goes back a couple of years. Each time it didn’t work out, I wondered if I would be able to buy a house at all.\nTick tock. It’s leap day 2016. Laurie informs me of a house that is being prepared to go on the market so we go see it a couple days later. I like it. On 3rd March I make the offer. On the 4th, it is accepted. 😱\nFive days ago, on 11th April, I got the keys to the house. I’m so happy and excited, even though I suspect that it hasn’t fully sunk in. I’ve never bought a house before, and except for six months, I’ve never lived in a single family home my whole life. I can’t wait to move in next week.\n[caption id=\u0026ldquo;attachment_332\u0026rdquo; align=\u0026ldquo;aligncenter\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;4032\u0026rdquo;] Photo by Jenni.[/caption]\nP.S. Oh, and by the way, if you know where I can get my hands on some Burundi Buziraguhindwa coffee, please let me know. I have more decisions to make in life.

June - While in LA, Liz had to undergo emergency surgery for the removal of her ruptured appendix. She returned home a week after that and has recuperated well. Got an iPhone 4 which has a decent enough camera that for the first time ever I'm comfortable with my phone being the only camera on my person when I travel. July - I had to fly down to LA and drive our car back from there since we flew Liz up to Portland after her surgery. Traded in the MINI for a Subaru Outback. We had to [let Yoshi go](https://blog.samgrover.com/2010/08/01/goodbye-yoshi/). August - My parents visited us in Portland and we had a great time showing them around Portland. We also visited Seattle, Crater Lake and Bend. September - Visited Disney World in Florida for ten days. It was a vacation for us and a chance for my parents to meet Liz's parents for the first time.

Unfortunately and unexpectedly now it\u0026rsquo;s time to say goodbye.\nYoshi started to show symptoms of great discomfort yesterday morning and we noticed blood in his urine shortly before noon. We immediately called his regular vet but they were about to close and asked us to go to Laurelhurst Veterinary Hospital (LVH) instead. So off we went. After his examination the doctor informed us that he is having urinary tract issues. He\u0026rsquo;s had other health issues earlier this year. The doctor informed us that since he is having these issues really early in his life, he will need constant medical attention and care in the future. Their best treatment recommendation greatly exceeded what we can afford right now. Combined with other unexpected financial events from this summer and the expected upcoming travels, it soon became apparent that we would have to make a hard decision. We informed the doctor of our predicament. She offered that they have a process in place to adopt a pet in such a circumstance, to nurse them back to health and put them up for adoption. With great sadness we decided to surrender Yoshi to their care. This way he gets the best, immediate, and adequate care and will find a new home with someone who can address his future needs as well. There are no words for our heartfelt gratitude to the folks at the LVH for adopting him into their care.\nYoshi was my first and only pet.

However, on the side, I was gaining strong interest in developing apps with Cocoa on the Mac and iPhone OS platform ever since I started working on that over a year ago.\nWhen I started to look around for a place to work on iPhone apps, Small Society was on the top of that list.

Pictures are [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/collections/72157618568809607/). January - Returned from trip to Asia. Bought a HDTV and a PS3. Been enjoying glorious Blu-Ray and some cool games since then. February - Started working on Avatari. My first Mac application in Cocoa. Had my first car accident. It was minor. April - Demoed and released [Avatari](https://samgrover.com/software/) at Demolicious. Liz and I went road-tripping thru the southwest. Visited Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, Monument Valley and Grand Canyon. Some of the most amazing landscapes I've ever seen. Pictures are [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157618655198144/). May - Liz and I went to Bend for a long weekend and had a great time exploring this cute little town and its surrounding volcanic geology. June - I became a [US permanent resident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_residence_%28United_States%29). No more visa hassles! August - Liz and I traveled to Kaua'i where we had a great time celebrating our first anniversary. Pictures are [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157622166004781/). September - Completed ten years of living in the US. Brought [Yoshi](https://blog.samgrover.com/2009/09/29/yoshi/) (our cat) home. My first pet ever. Bought an Olympus E-P1 to use as my primary camera succeeding the Bessa in that role. It was an amazing year and I’m looking forward to the next one. And lastly, here’s more about the number 33.\n","date":"2009-10-11","dateFormatted":"October 11, 2009","excerpt":"A few seconds ago I turned thirty-three.\nHere are some personally memorable events since my last birthday post:\nDecember - Liz and I traveled to Asia.

We stayed at some friends\u0026rsquo; place while they were on vacation. There were two house cats around, Woodrow and Wilson. At the end of that week I realized that I really enjoyed having a pet around. Liz had been keen on the idea for a while, so we decided to look for a kitty to adopt as soon as we got back.\nShe tweeted about it and got a response within twenty-four hours. Twenty days later, Yoshi arrived at our place. He is about ten eight weeks old and in the last week has learned to use the litter and become comfy in our apartment.

At the end of the movie I remarked that the Hercules flying boat, designed by Hughes, and shown in the film is on permanent display in our Oregon neighborhood. A few minutes of online searching later we decided to go check it out at the Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum in McMinnville on the weekend.\nSunday morning, after a brief breakfast stop at a local bagel joint, we drove out towards the museum. We passed beautiful hills draped with vineyards and wineries. Later in the day we learned that these were the Chehalem Mountains and Dundee Hills regions of the Willamette Valley Wineries. We hadn’t been there before and were delighted to see it. Eyeing all the wine tasting signs we decided to stop at some of the wineries on our way back.\nWe got to the museum about an hour before noon. It is located across the road from the airport in McMinnville. There are two museum buildings which house the aviation and space museums and a third building has an IMAX theater. Some aircraft are displayed in spaces along the buildings too. We only visited the aviation museum, choosing to return to the space museum on another day, perhaps after they install one of the retiring space shuttles, which they plan to do.\n![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3445/3920922773_b731541df5.jpg) It is clear upon looking at the aviation museum and the time spent inside it that the Hercules is their star attraction. It takes up most of the space and even though there are about a hundred other aircrafts spanning the hundred year history of powered flight, they all appear negligible next to it. The critics of this magnificent aircraft, the largest of its time, called it the “Spruce Goose”. Liz and I were disappointed that this name, which was despised by Hughes, was the one used prominently by the museum. Their website address uses it; they sport it on gift store items; and they even have a winery that makes wine branded the same.\n![](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2621/3918838670_87b241f19e.jpg) Even in their relative smallness, the other aircrafts on display offer a great collection of beautiful airplanes, helicopters, balloon-basket, a Wright 1903 Flyer replica and even a model skeleton of the wing-like device sketched by Leonardo DaVinci. There were some charming touches to the museum. Sitting next to a WW2 bomber was an old man who had flown one of those for thirty missions over France and Germany when he was eighteen. Alongside some planes were accurate models. One depicted intricately the machine gun wing assembly on a WW2 fighter. Next to the Hercules was a model of it used in the Scorsese film and donated to the museum.\n![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3531/3918842350_cf19d7463e.jpg) On our way back, we checked out a few wineries, tasted the wines at a couple of them and bought some at one in Dundee. I haven’t been a fan of wine most of my life, having sided with beer whenever presented a choice, but in recent times I have started to experiment. Now, having had some really delicious ones, I’m starting to become a fan to the extent that I know a bit about what I like and what I don\u0026rsquo;t like. My wine vocabulary remains minimal and will probably stay that way unless my interest in it skyrockets.\n![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3455/3918060129_77cf708e01.jpg) We drove back to Portland through a different, but similarly scenic route. To top off the lovely Sunday, which was filled with expected and unexpected pleasures, that night we saw Terry Jones’ Erik the Viking. It featured a different kind of flying boat and was quite hilarious.\n","date":"2009-09-14","dateFormatted":"September 14, 2009","excerpt":"Sometime last week, Liz and I saw Martin Scorsese’s The Aviator, a biographical film about Howard Hughes.

Here are some thoughts on my recent Netflix experience.\nI noticed the other day that when Netflix shows me ratings for a movie that I haven\u0026rsquo;t rated (the red stars), it is not showing me what I thought that was. The red stars show me what Netflix thinks I will rate the movie rather than the average of what others have rated. It is a prediction. This is not news, but is news to me. I don\u0026rsquo;t like it. I\u0026rsquo;d like to see the average rating given by others instead of the predicted rating for me. I\u0026rsquo;ve taken to hovering over each film\u0026rsquo;s title or image to get that information. It\u0026rsquo;s annoying but doable and I prefer it to the misleading red stars.\nRecently when Liz was away for a few weeks, I had a plan to watch a bunch of action flicks and such-like that I wanted to see and knew the she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to see. Not that she isn\u0026rsquo;t into action films; the other day we greatly enjoyed Inglourious Basterds. So I browsed for those films that I had heard of and those that folks recommended, added them to my queue, and moved them to the top. Soon enough they started showing up and I had a great time catching up on that genre. Now that Liz is back, the queue is as it was before she left and I\u0026rsquo;m faced with a slight problem. When I come across a film in the aforementioned genre, I would like to store it for another similar time in the future. However, I can\u0026rsquo;t just add it to my queue without constant annoying maintenance. I\u0026rsquo;d like a feature using which I can make a list of movies called “Sam\u0026rsquo;s Must-See Action Flix”. When Liz travels, I can make this list my active queue in one click. And then one-click should return the active queue to the regularly scheduled list when she returns. Simple.\nThe “Watch Instantly” feature of streaming movies is most excellent. I love it, despite the fact that it causes my browser to crash once each time I use it. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using it to see movies I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed before but not seen in a long time and also for those times when you just want to see something right away but aren\u0026rsquo;t in the mood for the DVD lying on the table. It would be most awesome if it worked directly with my PlayStation 3 but from what I\u0026rsquo;ve read that is not likely to happen anytime soon.\n","date":"2009-09-09","dateFormatted":"September 9, 2009","excerpt":"I’ve returned to using Netflix this year and it’s working out great for Liz and me, both film lovers.

The book is about food production and agriculture in the US. It is also about man\u0026rsquo;s relation to food and to the culture of eating. This is not a review of the book, but rather a summary of my thoughts on this subject as it relates to my personal health and habits.\nMany years ago I saw Super Size Me. Following that I stopped eating at McDonald\u0026rsquo;s and reduced my consumption of fast food in general. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I saw King Corn and The Future of Food that the reality of industrial agriculture began to sink in. I was increasingly disgusted by what I was eating.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been altering my food habits towards ones that I believe will support the goal of a healthier life. Habits, that were encouraged by my parents while I was growing up, but those that I easily ignored in my adult independence. My mom taught me that just about anything is good in moderation but nothing is good in excess. Pollan\u0026rsquo;s observations on food show just how much excess is involved in industrial food. Observations of my own diet revealed that I was having too much meat and processed food and not enough vegetables, whole grains and fruits. I also found a large amount of HFCS in my diet, mostly from soda, but also, and this was a surprise to me, from ketchup and other products.\nThroughout my twenties, I didn\u0026rsquo;t think twice about what I was eating as long as it tasted good, and often, fast and convenient. My younger body could take that abuse without much consequence. My older body won\u0026rsquo;t tolerate abuse as it gets confused and transformed by the bad food I eat. It is imperative that I live a healthy life and for that it is necessary that I eat healthy food. Enough is enough.\nHaving moved to the US from India, I\u0026rsquo;ve always admired the nutrition label on foods sold here. What I had often ignored was the list of ingredients. Now, more than ever, I find that information very valuable when eating or buying food. Labeling is important and I would like to see it become even more descriptive to capture the source of ingredients and to their status as GMOs. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to those that research information about food and agriculture and seek to have it readily accessible.\nOver the last few months I\u0026rsquo;ve been eating much less meat. I have eliminated HFCS from my diet. I have greatly reduced the consumption of processed food and increased the consumption of whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables. I acknowledge that as I seek to minimize my consumption of unhealthy food I may occasionally give in to the desires of speed, convenience or taste. Having Liz in my life has significantly helped to reintroduce and encourage healthier eating habits. Her food ethic is much stronger than mine and she is acutely conscious of what she consumes.\nAs an omnivore I can eat many things, but I won\u0026rsquo;t just eat any thing.\n","date":"2009-06-13","dateFormatted":"June 13, 2009","excerpt":"A couple of weeks ago I finished reading Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals.

He has recently written a couple of them that hit close to home. They are The Leica as Teacher and Why It Has To Be a Leica. Mike suggests a training program using the Leica for a year to shoot B\u0026amp;W film extensively and to edit and critique oneself on the photos taken. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to do exactly that over the last two years.\n![](https://farm1.static.flickr.com/174/423814367_99f7c65e86.jpg) There are some differences, of course. My camera has been a Bessa R2A. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using only that camera with a 50mm prime lens since January 2007. The Bessa is like a cheaper version of a Leica. Most of the points that Mike mentions in the second post apply to the Bessa too.\nCertainly, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been as prolific as Mike suggests. Much has happened in my life since then and other interests have sometimes taken priority in spare time. As of today I have 362 photos on Flickr taken with this camera and lens pair. That\u0026rsquo;s an average of about three selected photos per week, although in reality there were bursts of activity when I was on vacation. About half of those photos are B\u0026amp;W. I typically haven\u0026rsquo;t thought in terms of color unless it felt quite essential, and have preferred B\u0026amp;W film for the most part.\n![](https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1096/1429078633_aaf15ea785.jpg) The gist of the matter is that this is a really good exercise. In the end, like Mike says,\nBecause make no mistake, photographing the way I suggested in the previous post is the photographic equivalent of being a top athlete: it takes dedication and coordination and talent and time and sacrifice and lots of training. This gels with what Malcolm Gladwell has written in Outliers and with my own experience. What matters most is that you put a lot of time and effort into it. The constraints Mike suggests help to make the exercise even more focused, pun unintended. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not the only exercise out there but I sincerely believe that if you were to do this, it would greatly benefit your photographic eye. I can surely feel it and perhaps my photography shows it.\n![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3326/3514997446_a58366eb95.jpg) When I started using my Bessa, I dumped my DSLR and haven\u0026rsquo;t missed it since. Having said that, I think I\u0026rsquo;m getting weary of having a film based workflow as my primary one. I\u0026rsquo;m still hoping that a nice digital rangefinder will come along or that I will find it reasonable to invest in a Leica M8. Until then I may try the new Sigma DP2. It looks quite promising. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep an eye out for the news and reviews and look at photos from it for a couple of months before deciding.\n","date":"2009-05-30","dateFormatted":"May 30, 2009","excerpt":"Mike Johnston, over at T.O.P, writes interesting posts quite often.

Life, as usual, is way more varied. Here\u0026rsquo;s a recap of some travels and photos from the last few months.\nLate last year, Liz and I traveled to Asia. We visited her Nepalese home near Kathmandu, had our second wedding of the year in New Delhi and then went to Bali for our honeymoon. That\u0026rsquo;s a whole \u0026rsquo;nother blog post that one of us will eventually write on our blog. Oh, but the pictures are ready to go in my Asia 2008 collection on Flickr.\n![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3374/3176230852_b0399bb192.jpg) Our first trip this year was during the last week of April. Liz and I went on a road trip in the Colorado plateau area. We flew in to Las Vegas and drove to Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park. It was an amazing set of places to see with wondrous natural landscapes; the product of water, stone and time. We spent four nights camping and three in hotels. An exploration of that trip will also be in our blog soon, I promise! Once again, the photos are ready :-)\n![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3342/3550092353_7dd574b22f.jpg) These two trips have been my primary outlet in taking photos over the past several months. I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with the resulting pictures. I am, however, starting to feel tired of using film and the related workflow and cost. I hope I can make the transition to a decent digital rangefinder sometime over the next year or so although I will have to save up for one of those!\n![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3646/3484075785_a4d168bdda.jpg) Tomorrow Liz and I will be going to Bend in central Oregon for this Memorial Day weekend and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to explore new places and take a bunch of more photos.

I keep my avatar the same most of the time but every now and then I would replace it for a short period to represent a holiday or a cause or some event. When I would do that it would annoy me that I had to go to each individual location where I had uploaded my avatar for a brief replacement.\nNot anymore.\nI made Avatari to solve this problem. It currently supports multiple accounts on Twitter and FriendFeed. When I came up with this idea, I found that Twitter already had an API for uploading an avatar but FriendFeed didn\u0026rsquo;t. I requested the folks at FriendFeed to create an API for me, and to my pleasant surprise, they had one ready in twenty days. Thanks guys! I hope to add more services in the future.\nMy other motivation for making Avatari is to teach myself Cocoa programming. I had hoped to make something useful while familiarizing myself with Cocoa. It\u0026rsquo;s working great and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to advance my knowledge of Cocoa software development with continued effort.\nLast week I presented Avatari to the folks at Portland CocoaHeads and tonight I presented it at Demolicious.

Even though my best video game experiences have been on a PC, the Wii holds its own and is a pleasure to play. I started with the wonderful Super Mario Galaxy and it was the only Wii game I played until a couple of months ago. Then, for five days each, I rented Transformers, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, one after another. And although I didn\u0026rsquo;t really get in to Brawl, I thoroughly enjoyed the other two.\nThen came October, and my awesome mother-in-law completely surprised me with two Wii games for my birthday. Pirates of the Carribean: At World\u0026rsquo;s End and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Both are based on movies that I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen. I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed The Mummy more than Pirates.\nThen came November, and keeping in mind that Liz and I will be off to Asia during Christmas, my mom-in-law sent our presents early. Guess what I got, among other things? Yea, that\u0026rsquo;s right, two more Wii games! Iron Man and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Each based on a movie that I have seen multiple times. Awesome! I haven\u0026rsquo;t played Fantastic Four yet, but Iron Man has been fun so far.\nNext week Liz and I leave for a vacation to Asia, but when I\u0026rsquo;m back in January, I\u0026rsquo;ll sure have a bunch of Wii games to play :)\n","date":"2008-11-22","dateFormatted":"November 22, 2008","excerpt":"![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3141/3051210196_df7e418508_m.jpg) It has been a little over eight months since I [bought the Wii](https://blog.samgrover.com/2008/03/16/time-to-play-again/).

A few seconds ago I turned thirty-two.\nHere are some personally memorable events since my last birthday:\nOctober - Made a trip to India for dad's 60th birthday celebration. January - Got all four of my wisdom teeth extracted. Two had to be dug out. Was on a soup diet for a couple of weeks. February - Created the first version of the [LazyEngine](https://lazyengine.appspot.com/). March - Asked Liz to marry me. She said yes. Bought a Wii. The engagement was decidedly more memorable, but the Wii has been fun too :-) April - Attended a concert by Zakir Hussain and met him. May - Went to the hot springs at Brietenbush. Sis and niece came over to visit. We all had a great time. June - Moved to a new place right next to the river in NW Portland. Liz spoke at Ignite Portland 3. July - Liz and I made a [trip to Maine](https://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/our-trip-to-maine/) to visit her parents and to spend the 4th of July holiday with them. Later that month, I traveled to Porto, Portugal to attend a conference. Lovely little city. It was my first time in Europe. August - Liz and I had our [Portland wedding](https://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/we-got-married/). Our New Delhi wedding is in December. We went to Crater Lake for a weekend. Beautiful place. Our first time there. I traveled to San Francisco to showcase my work. September - I hacked together [ff2tweet](https://github.com/samgrover/ff2tweet/tree/master).

I went to Portugal for a trip towards the end of July. I was attending the SECRYPT conference and presenting my paper there. All I knew about Porto, was what I read on Wikipedia and other places online. I was looking forward to a cute historic European city and that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what I got.\n![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3215/2705654507_fb504dbc68_m.jpg)\nI reached there on a Friday afternoon, quite jet-lagged. The hotel (Hotel Melia Gaia Porto) was in the area south of the Douro river called Vila Nova De Gaia. That evening I got food at a nearby place and explored about a mile around the hotel, partly in search of a wall adapter for my laptop power cord. Walking around Gaia reminded me of India, especially my maternal grandma\u0026rsquo;s neighborhood in Delhi. The streets are narrow. The cars are small. Old rustic architecture is mixed with modern glassy facades.\n![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3126/2706426294_ac1ae192e7_m.jpg)\nThe conference was at the hotel and ran from Saturday thru Tuesday. Each day, I would attend sessions until about 6pm and then head out to explore the city. On Saturday I took a leisurely photowalk towards the city center. As I got closer to the river, historic buildings appeared and this time I was reminded of Bombay, which has a heavy Portugese influence. The extent of that influence was more than I realized. I rediscovered words that I thought were of Indian origin, only to find that they were in fact Portugese. In Bombay, the word for bread is \u0026lsquo;pao\u0026rsquo; and the word for potato is \u0026lsquo;batata\u0026rsquo;. Both of those are Portugese words. This discovery surprised my friends and family too.\n![](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3226/2726032241_fcd088a46c_m.jpg)\nOver the next few days I explored several areas around the Porto city center. The metro was very convenient. On my last day there I went to Casa da Música. It is an interesting building with non-perpendicular corners and a variety of unique rooms. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was completely open to the public for free. You could just walk into and all around its various rooms, even into the main auditorium. You could sit at a Steinway grand piano and play to your heart\u0026rsquo;s content and no one would bother. I didn\u0026rsquo;t because I don\u0026rsquo;t know how but a guy was doing just that.\nOverall the trip was productive and pleasant, definitely whetting my appetite to explore more of Europe. My photos from the trip are in the slideshow below.

I had ignored my cardinal law in purchasing a camera, \u0026ldquo;Hold it in your hands to see how it feels\u0026rdquo;. One year has gone by with me using the Bessa exclusively, and I love it.\nI bought it along with a 50mm Nokton f/1.5 lens and an adapter. The camera has an M mount, whereas the lens is a screw mount, so I needed an adapter. My plan was that if I liked this enough I could get an M mount Leica lens in the future and it would fit just fine with the camera. I still plan on doing that. Perhaps a 35mm lens, but more on that later. I bought this Bessa at CameraQuest, a website that I haven\u0026rsquo;t visited since then. I never planned on buying more of this system and I never had any issues.\nMy early experience with a rangefinder camera was in 2006 when I borrowed a Canonet QL17 G-III from my friend Doug. At the end of that month I was hooked and understood why the rangefinder is the best camera for street photography. A sentiment expressed by many a famous street photographers of the last century. My favorite part about a rangefinder is that since I can see the frame lines, I can see the things that I\u0026rsquo;m not including in the frame. You can never do that with an SLR. That allows me to frame the shot best, especially on the street when I have only a fraction of a second to frame and shoot a photo. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about focusing because I pre-focus and set a high depth-of-field. When I bring the camera to my eye, all I have to do is frame and click. And I love it when the camera goes \u0026ldquo;click\u0026rdquo;. The Bessa has a quick sharp sound that is barely noticeable as compared to the extended louder sound of the DSLR.\nAnother characteristic of the rangefinder is that you can see the photo at the moment of exposure, while in the SLR you just see nothing. As a result, at the beginning, my timing was a bit off with this camera, but not only did I get used to it, I started to love it. Most of the time I take a photo, I just click one frame. No second chance. So it helps to know if I got what I was going for, even though the suspense remains until I actually get the film processed.\nOver the last year I\u0026rsquo;ve put up 193 photos taken with this camera on my Flickr photostream, about 76% of all my uploaded photos for 2007. That\u0026rsquo;s not an immense number and probably would\u0026rsquo;ve been even smaller had I not made the trips to Burning Man and to India. I put up 481 photos in 2006 and 807 photos in 2005. I think the trend is down because the cost of using film has made me frugal.\nI like using film because of the texture that it imparts to a photograph. I haven\u0026rsquo;t experimented a whole lot with different films, and settled quite early with Tri-X. Most of the time I push it to ISO 1600 and gives me just the right kind of contrast I like. It also helps to push the film in Portland, since most days are overcast and higher ISO films cost more ;-) Having said that, more and more manufacturers of are moving out of the 35mm film market. That trend has me thinking of digital rangefinders for the future. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how that goes.\nI think I\u0026rsquo;ve spent enough time with the 50mm lens to now explore more primes. I would prefer to go wider, as that\u0026rsquo;s what I find lacking sometimes when I frame a shot. Also, I think it would help me get closer while out on the street. So, sometime this year, I\u0026rsquo;ll get a 35mm M mount lens, hopefully a Leica one.

I thought that perhaps the Sunday incident had flared up. I hadn't read the news this morning, so I called him and he told me about the bomb blasts. Seven bombs went off on board various trains of the western lines within one hour (Mapped locations). For more info and details from the blogosphere, see Ultrabrown, Vantage Point, Sepia Mutiny, MumbaiHelp, and Metroblogging Mumbai. Unfortunately, this isn't the first time this beloved city has been a target.\nJust the other day, in conversation with friends, I was reminiscing my experiences with riding the trains in Bombay. I grew up there through most of the nineties, mid-teens to early twenties. Rush hour travel is the kind of thing you'd remember fondly only if you were nostalgic. The train cars are sometimes packed so tight, one could travel upright without either foot on the floor. 4.5 million people commute on the trains everyday. With that in mind, the horror of these events is inescapable. Emotions will run high, we'll all mourn, but the people of Mumbai will not be terrorized.\nIn 1993, in the days after the thirteen serial bomb blasts in two hours, there were billboards proclaiming that the city got back on it's feet within 24 hours. In memory of those who died, I hope that spirit prevails, that the aftermath is peaceful, and that the perpetrators are brought to justice.\n","date":"2006-07-11","dateFormatted":"July 11, 2006","excerpt":"I was on my short commute today when I got a text message from my father in India.

But there are a few little things for which I could use one and that is why it's great to see a free web application from Google that provides it.\nI started to use Google Spreadsheets yesterday and found it very convenient and simple to use. It offers some basic functionality for now but that's ok since it's only a limited test. It can import and export XLS and CSV files at the moment, so I converted my few files from a simple text format into CSV and they were smoothly imported. The application looks quite slick. This is the first application from Google that looks a lot like a desktop application. It has menus near the top with similar items as a standard desktop application. There are buttons for the usual suspects; Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo and Redo. It has collaborative features to let multiple users edit the same file and provides a chat interface too. I haven't tried that yet. I'm looking forward to more such applications. I'm guessing that I'll use some of them while others I won't, picking and choosing depending on usage, usability and desktop alternative availability.\nAnd now for the idle speculation part, which kinda builds on what I first read a long time ago. This new product makes me wonder that with the known and unknown components below their web applications, Google probably has a development platform for hosting applications on their infrastructure. I wonder if they would make it available to developers too. Let's call it the environment for Google Developers, or eGoD ;-). They could potentially let eGoD applications reside on the developer's own hardware, but they can't really fulfill their \u0026quot;mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\u0026quot; if it's not on their own infrastructure*. A reason for developers to let Google host their eGoD applications may be to guarantee good performance by utilizing a large scale distributed system that is managed and maintained by Google. Another reason would be that all eGoD applications would be \u0026quot;local\u0026quot; to each other and to Google services so if they wish to exchange information, they would be able to do so very efficiently. I've read time and again that infrastructure is one of Google's main strengths and I think that is absolutely true.\nA Google branded word processor based on Writely will surely come out soon. I don't know if these applications are the beginning of a challenge to Microsoft Office, at least not until the technologies and interfaces are more mature. However they demonstrate the capability of this imaginary eGoD platform. Such a development and hosting environment is bound to be disruptive in the desktop application ecosphere. Google may go after a big slice of the pie with Office, leaving the niche products to the small developers. Just like Microsoft did with their platform, Windows.\nBy the way, they provide Google Base for people to give them their deep web information.

The camera is a Canonet QL17 G-III. I've gone through one roll on it and it's been fun to use so far. I had been using SLR cameras until now and the rangefinder is quite different in operation. The major difference being that the image viewed through the viewfinder is not the same as the one that is seen by the lens. In an SLR you see through the lens, so it's more of a WYSIWYG interface. Here are some of my impressions with using this camera.\nIt\u0026#039;s a little bizzare to see the lens through the viewfinder, but I got over that pretty soon. It is well known that rangefinders are quiet because they don\u0026#039;t have a moving mirror. Even so, I was surprised by the quietness of the mechanism. The shutter priority operation threw me off for a while because I\u0026#039;m used to shooting with aperture priority. It makes me think in terms of time, while I\u0026#039;m used to thinking in terms of depth of field, or rather not thinking much in terms of either by setting the parameters once and not messing with it unless really needed. ![](https://static.flickr.com/50/151705515_58bd3e843d_m.jpg)The hardest thing to do was the focusing. The viewfinder has a very small area to check the focus accurately, and its not something I could manage to do quickly. I found myself pre-focusing most of the time by reading the distance marking on the lens. So, I used the viewfinder only for framing, just before taking the picture. I like the speed of such operation, but have been reluctant to do pre-focusing before now. This camera kinda forced it upon me and I\u0026#039;ll try to do it more often. I think it is a good skill to have for street photography, especially when using a manual focus mechanism. There is usually no time to focus. It's been raining again for the last week, so I haven't had any chance to shoot more with this camera.

So, off I went for a dose of the ultraviolence.\nThe theater manager informed us that it was the largest turnout in their current series of classic films. The print was an original one, scratches and all. There was even a bit of trouble with it towards the end, which caused a pause in the show. That brought on comments, the likes of which are only heard when the audience comprises fans of a cult classic.\nThere are many cool things about this movie. The dialogues are peppered with [Nadsat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadsat), which Burgess invented. Some things made sense only on repeat viewing. That is probably one of the hallmarks of a cult movie, I guess. The movie is beautiful to look at, with lovely locations and colorful costumes. The performances are superb. But the best part, in my opinion, is the music. Beethoven's 9th Symphony forms a part of the story and is partially heard in Wendy Carlos' electronic rendition.\nSee it.

Google is a major focus of the book, and its influence and growth surely warrant that focus.\nWhat motivated me to read this book was the concept of the \"[Database of Intentions](https://battellemedia.com/archives/000063.php)\". It refers to the ability of an ubiquitous search technology to extract the intention of one or more of its users by analyzing their interactions with a plethora of devices. That is absolutely fascinating and will be quite something when it is realized. Needless to say, it will be the Oracle of the information age. It is an update on the idea of the Memex described by Vannevar Bush in \"As We May Think\", which is cited in the book. A meta-Memex.\nA good portion of the book, however, is devoted to the history of search technology and industry. That is quite interesting in and of itself as I like to read about such things. There are several anecdotes about the people and companies that played a part in these nascent times. I found it to be too detailed in some places, but the book is written such that one could easily skip those parts if one finds them too dull. I didn't.\nThe epilogue highlights that we remember people from history because they became immortal through records. In the future, everyone will be immortal because everything will be recorded. This blog is being recorded. All of it will add to the noise and one will have to shout or be referenced a lot to be seen clearly. Will you shout? What will you say?
