Noting how often you open the fridge and for how long it stays open.
Noting how often you open bags that sound like they contain chips.
That song you&rsquo;re humming.
Noting how often you sniff, or cough, or clear your throat.
Noting the sounds your appliance makes, to detect the make and model, or the settings you use.
Noting how often you answer your phone, as opposed to declining the call.
Noting which notifications are you most likely to respond to by picking up and unlocking your phone.
That deep breath you just took after a particular notification rang on a particular device.
That bag of chips you opened a short while after you took that deep breath.

And of course, correlating this data to the time, date, current weather conditions, and past behavior."/>

<p>Perhaps the company that makes the assistant also knows the content of those notifications and everything else happening on that device because they make that as well.</p>
<p>The machine is learning.</p>
