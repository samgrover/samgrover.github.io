  <meta name="description" content="
Last Saturday we went hiking at Angel&rsquo;s Rest in the gorge. I&rsquo;ve been on this hike several times and always enjoy it. It is only a thirty minute drive from home, and offers great views and a good workout.

This trail, along with many others had been closed for over a year since the Eagle Creek Fire, and had reopened last fall.

All the way from the trailhead to the viewpoint on the top of the cliff there were charred trees. I&rsquo;ve never hiked through a place devastated by fire before, so it was a new an interesting experience from that regard." />
