<h1>Initial experience with Setapp</h1>

Apr. 14, 2019


<br/><br/>
<p>I signed up for <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8">Setapp</a> for a free trial week. Setapp is an app subscription service for macOS where you sign up for $10 a month to gain full access to a catalog of over 100 apps.</p>
<p>This is not a review of Setapp, but rather my initial experience with it after having heard about it a few times on the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/">Mac Power Users</a> podcast. Many of apps in the Setapp catalog are well known and as such I was already aware of them. But there are several that are new to me.</p>
<p>Apps that I found myself using often during the trial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marked</li>
<li>Mindnode</li>
<li>Flume</li>
<li>Timing</li>
<li>iStat Menus</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps I installed and use occasionally and would expect to use occasionally in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi Explorer</li>
<li>World Clock Pro</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps I tried but then uninstalled after using just one or two times:</p>
<ul>
<li>CleanMyMac X</li>
<li>IconJar</li>
<li>Luminar Flex</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps that are included in Setapp but which I&rsquo;ve previously bought individually and use anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screens</li>
<li>Paw</li>
<li>Sip</li>
</ul>
<p>So with a very rough mental calculation I think the math would work out alright. Of course the main hook/promise of Setapp is the <em>potential</em> of all the other apps. Many may not be relevant today but may become relevant tomorrow. Their <a href="https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000890969-Setapp-applications">stated goal</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have 100+ apps in the stack and are steadily adding more of them to cover all of your main needs. Eventually, Setapp is to deliver about 300 Mac apps, all per a single $9.99 fee (+ taxes).</p></blockquote>
<p>I have already identified some apps that I plan to use soon but just didn&rsquo;t have a chance to use during the trial period. I&rsquo;ve now subscribed for one month, and if it still seems useful after that, I will likely switch to the annual plan for 10% off.</p>
<p>If you would like to try out Setapp, <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8">select here to use my referral code</a>.</p>
