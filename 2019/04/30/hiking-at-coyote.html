<p>Last weekend we went hiking at <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Coyote_Wall_Hike">Coyote Wall</a>. Jenni and I had never been to this hike before but our friends were familiar with it.</p>
<p>There are multiple trails that meet each other at various points. Some are gentle slopes, while others are steeper. One can pick and choose paths based on how much of a workout one wants and switch that around as needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/0ed951ee0d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are beautiful vistas all along the way to the top of the wall. I could see myself bringing family and friends here that are not used to hiking much, to just go for a bit, enjoy the views, and head back.</p>

<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/e3a9317ab9.jpg" alt="Herbie was happy to lead us for a bit"></p>
<p>There are cute little waterfalls and streams as well along the way.</p>

<p>Spring flowers, sunny weather, and spotty clouds, made everything look a lot more beautiful.</p>

<p>At the top, we hung out for a bit to have snacks and enjoy the views some more.</p>

<p>On the way down we took the steeper route for a bit. Some folks were mountain biking along the cliff and down the steep trails, which was incredible to watch but not something I see myself doing üòÖ</p>

<p>I can see myself coming back to this hike again in the spring, and probably in other seasons as well.</p>
