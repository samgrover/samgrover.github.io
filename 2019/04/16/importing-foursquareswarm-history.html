<h1>Importing Foursquare/Swarm history into Day One</h1>

Apr. 16, 2019


<br/><br/>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been journaling in <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> for some time now. I like it for a lot of reasons, and it&rsquo;s working out great. So far I&rsquo;ve been using it as a plain old journal, where you write what&rsquo;s on your mind. Recently, I decided that I wanted to get my digital history into it as well. One of the first things that came to mind was my <a href="https://foursquare.com">Foursquare/Swarm</a> checkin history which goes back to 2009. I decided to start there.</p>
<p>I exported all my data and wrote a script in Python to extract what I needed from it to make journal entries. The two relevant files were <code>checkins.json</code> and <code>photos.json</code>. You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/samgrover/26939e0b68a26b7fe03a7a4bd37bdcf6">get my script on Github by selecting here</a> if you&rsquo;d like to use it, or dig into it. It should also appear embedded at the end of this post. First the script pre-processes the data to get all the photos attached to checkins. Then it goes over the checkin history to extract most of what I want, but since the exported data doesn&rsquo;t include venue coordinates, it has to do a little more.</p>
<p>It makes calls to the <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs">Foursquare API</a> to fetch the venue coordinates for each checkin. Then it puts everything together and makes the actual entry using Day One&rsquo;s <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/support/CLI">command line utility</a>. I had several thousand entries but the free plan for the API has a daily limit of 500 calls, so I manually ran it a few times over the course of a couple of weeks until they&rsquo;d all been imported. I could&rsquo;ve automated that but I wasn&rsquo;t keen on spending the time on that.</p>
<p>Day One does allow one to link it to <a href="https://help.dayoneapp.com/tips-and-tutorials/using-ifttt-with-day-one">IFTTT</a> so that all <em>new</em> checkins get logged automatically, and I enabled that a while back, but I&rsquo;ve not been happy with that integration. Now that I&rsquo;m familiar with the flow of data, I plan to create new entries every couple of months or so, perhaps with a new script that works entirely with the API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear if you have automated any journaling as I&rsquo;m keen to explore other ways of doing so myself.</p>
