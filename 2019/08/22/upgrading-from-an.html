<h1>Upgrading From an External RAID 0 of Two Hard Disks to a Single SSD</h1>

Aug. 22, 2019


<br/><br/>
<p>I’ve been using a <a href="https://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbay-4">OWC Thunderbay 4 (Thunderbolt 2)</a> external enclosure with four 3 TB hard disk drives for the last two years. I bought it on eBay as a new but opened product. It’s been great. I had two of the drives in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_0">RAID 0</a> configuration (for higher bandwidth single volume) and they were serving as the primary storage of about 1 TB of photos.</p>
<p>Recently I decided to partially upgrade that setup by purchasing a Crucial 2 TB SSD. In order to install it I also had to purchase a <a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/MEQX3TRAY/">OWC Spare Drive Tray</a> since the ones in my Thunderbay didn’t have the right setup for 2.5” drives. That took a few days to arrive. In the meantime I installed the SSD into an old USB LaCie enclosure and moved my files over to it.</p>
<p>I decided to measure the drive performance as I went through this process. And for that I used <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550?mt=12">Blackmagic Disk Speed Test</a> which is available for free on the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Each disk in my original setup had about 190 MB/s read/write speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/555d71e507.jpg" alt="Individual hard disk performance in Thunderbay 4."></p>
<p>The RAID 0 gave me about 300-320 MB/s. I forgot to speed test it before I removed it, but that’s what I recall from back when I first set it up.</p>
<p>In the intermediate setup with the LaCie enclosure I got about 250 MB/s write and 270 MB/s read speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/db8b2160a7.jpg" alt="SSD inside LaCie enclosure."></p>
<p>Once the drive tray arrived, I moved the SSD over to that and into the Thunderbay for the final setup where I’m now getting about 350 MB/s write and about 380 MB/s read speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/7d7e7f5628.jpg" alt="SSD in Thunderbay."></p>
<p>I may be able to extract some more performance from this SSD by making some other purchases and changes, but I don’t feel compelled to do that at this time. This is better than what I had, and quite acceptable for my use. In fact I felt totally comfortable moving my iCloud Photo library over to it as well. This freed up about a third of my internal drive storage.</p>
<p>I could’ve done this sooner but the tradeoff of storage size vs. price didn’t seem worth it. In the future I may keep an eye on the price of such drives and pick up at sale to upgrade more of my Thunderbay drives.</p>
<p>And in the foolhardy-comparison-department, here’s the crazy fast speed on the internal SSD on my iMac (Retina 5K, 27”, 2017 model).</p>
