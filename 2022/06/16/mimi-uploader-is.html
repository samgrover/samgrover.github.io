<h1>Mimi Uploader 2022.0 is out with new features for Recent Uploads ðŸŽ‰</h1>

Jun. 16, 2022


<br/><br/>
<p>Recent Uploads used to show only the uploads you make from Mimi Uploader. With the new update it will also show uploads made to your Micro.blog account from anywhere else.</p>
<p>Mimi is primarily a batch uploader and that is my favorite way of using it. I like to make blog posts that have a set of photos, and making that process smoother was the motivation to create Mimi in the first place. As such, each batch of photos shows up in Recent Uploads as a set.</p>
<p>The other uploads to a Micro.blog account are only accessible as individual images and are shown inline with the sets of Mimi uploads in the same reverse chronological list. A badge is used to indicate one type or another. There are other minor UI differences between the two types in the list, e.g. Mimi uploads shows a count of images. On the top right is a filter button that lets you filter for one type or another, if you choose to do so. The screenshots below show the new interface.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/39c018e6a5.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/39c018e6a5.png" alt="Screenshots showing interface changes described above."></a></p>
<p>Exporting still works the same way with a right swipe. Sets of uploads made from Mimi can still be deleted with a left swipe. As always this only deletes the batch from Mimi and doesn&rsquo;t affect the uploaded images. Other uploads don&rsquo;t offer the deletion because they are representing the images on Micro.blog and not an uploaded set.</p>
<p>I hope you like this update as much as I liked making it.</p>

<p>Upload images using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">Mimi</a>.</p>
