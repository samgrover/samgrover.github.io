  <meta name="description" content="Inspired by Patrick Rhone&rsquo;s /reading page, I&rsquo;ve created a Books page on my site.
Following is the process I followed to make that happen on my Mac:

Export all my books out of Goodreads. You can find the page to do that by navigating to &ldquo;My Books&rdquo; and selecting &ldquo;Import and export&rdquo; at the bottom of the left sidebar under &ldquo;Tools&rdquo;. The exported file is of CSV format, which is pretty standard.
Open the export file in a spreadsheeting app. I use Numbers.app. Here, you can clean up any data. I added some ISBNs that were missing. I also saved this file so I can just update it in the future as I read books. Another reason I went through this step was because I was having a hard time parsing the original CSV file using the script I wrote.
Export the spreadsheet file as CSV.
Run it through the script below to generate Markdown that can be pasted directly into the page on my site.

And that&rsquo;s it!" />
