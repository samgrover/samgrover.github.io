Some notes:

I constrained myself to photos taken on that day. No digging into the archives.
A lot of these were taken around the house or the neighborhood. I work from home and tend to go on walks at various times during the day.
Some days I took the photo but forgot to post and posted the next morning.
I don&rsquo;t usually do photo challenges, daily or otherwise, so this was harder than I expected. Some days I kinda winged it, as can be seen 😜.
