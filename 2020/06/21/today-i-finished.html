<meta name="twitter:description" content="A couple of days ago I finished reading The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin. It was published fifty-one years ago, but feels like it could&rsquo;ve been this year. A wonderful and timeless story written with immaculate detail, and emotional depth. There were many sentences all over the book that I read more than once because they were worth savoring.
I first heard of Ursula K. Le Guin a long time ago. At the time I thought of her as a Fantasy author, and I used to think of myself as someone that enjoys reading Sci-Fi, but not Fantasy. It was an arbitrary distinction that I hope is behind me. But as a result I didn&rsquo;t introduce myself to her work even though she was frequently mentioned in the context of Sci-Fi. I hope to read more of her works in the future."/>

<p>A couple of days ago I finished reading <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780441478125?aff=samgrover">The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin</a>. It was published fifty-one years ago, but feels like it could&rsquo;ve been this year. A wonderful and timeless story written with immaculate detail, and emotional depth. There were many sentences all over the book that I read more than once because they were worth savoring.</p>
<p>I first heard of Ursula K. Le Guin a long time ago. At the time I thought of her as a Fantasy author, and I used to think of myself as someone that enjoys reading Sci-Fi, but not Fantasy.
