Some notes:

I constrained myself to photos taken on that day. No digging into the archives.
A lot of these were taken around the house or the neighborhood, i.e. the pandemic life.
There was one day where I took a photo but forgot to post and posted the next morning. So there goes my 30 day photo blogging pin on Micro.blog. Again 🤦‍♂️
Some days I kinda winged it, as can be seen 😬.
This photo challenge was managed by @macgenie.
The last one I did was the February photoblogging challenge.
