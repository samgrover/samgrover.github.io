<h1>Magic Trackpad 2 or: How I Started to Prefer Gestures and Taps to Gripping and Clicking</h1>

<p>About three months ago I heard of someone using a trackpad with their non-dominant hand at their Mac. Now I&rsquo;d heard of such a use before but this time I had a trackpad lying around. I&rsquo;d gotten it with my Mac instead of a mouse because I already had a mouse, but had stashed it away. So I got it out and set it up for my left hand.</p>
<p>A month passed. I was using it rarely. One day the battery in my mouse ran out in the middle of the workday, so I plugged it in and moved the trackpad over to the right side.</p>
<p>A day passed, and the mouse had long been charged, so I unplugged it, but for whatever reason I kept using the trackpad.</p>
<p>A week passed and I realized that I was liking the trackpad a lot more than the mouse. So I put the mouse in the closet.</p>
<p>Now two months have passed and I can&rsquo;t think of going back. The gestures are intuitive and I&rsquo;ve found several operations to be a lot smoother.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a happy <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRMF2LL/A/">Magic Trackpad 2</a> user ðŸ˜Š.</p>
