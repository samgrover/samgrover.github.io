<p>Yesterday I finished reading The Broken Earth Trilogy by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._K._Jemisin">N.K. Jemisin</a>.</p>
<p>I read the first book last year. I was sufficiently intrigued that I bought the second book soon after, but for whatever reason I didn&rsquo;t start reading it until a couple of months ago. Fortunately it starts in a way that helped recall the story within the first few chapters. It then built upon the world and the characters as any good middle book. Once I&rsquo;d finished that, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to read the third one. I bought it right away and read it voraciously over the last two weeks. It did a great job of tying it all together and was very satisfying.</p>
<p>These books have been my introduction to the work of N.K. Jemisin and I&rsquo;m looking forward to reading more of her work in the future.</p>
