<p>I&rsquo;ve had my suspicions that I would enjoy having a cat as a pet. A month ago those suspicions were confirmed, and now I have my first pet ever.</p>
<p>Liz and I had the pleasure of hanging out in Kaua&rsquo;i for about a week (See pictures <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157622166004781/detail/">here</a>!). We stayed at some friends&rsquo; place while they were on vacation. There were two house cats around, Woodrow and Wilson. At the end of that week I realized that I really enjoyed having a pet around. Liz had been keen on the idea for a while, so we decided to look for a kitty to adopt as soon as we got back.</p>
<p>She <a href="http://twitter.com/lilbutterfly/status/3652400690/">tweeted about it</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/kcomandich/status/3670452022/">got a response</a> within twenty-four hours. Twenty days later, Yoshi arrived at our place. He is about <strike>ten</strike> eight weeks old and in the last week has learned to use the litter and become comfy in our apartment. He&rsquo;s very entertaining and we&rsquo;re having a great time having him around.</p>
