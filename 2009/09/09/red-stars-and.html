<h1>Red Stars and Other Netflix Musings</h1>

Sep. 9, 2009


<br/><br/>
<p>I&rsquo;ve returned to using Netflix this year and it&rsquo;s working out great for Liz and me, both film lovers. Here are some thoughts on my recent Netflix experience.</p>
<p>I noticed the other day that when Netflix shows me ratings for a movie that I haven&rsquo;t rated (the red stars), it is not showing me what I thought that was. The red stars show me what Netflix thinks I will rate the movie rather than the average of what others have rated. It is a prediction. This is <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2007/10/your-profile-page.html?showComment=1191954420000#c4039331185929945585" target="_self">not news</a>, but is news to me. I don&rsquo;t like it. I&rsquo;d like to see the average rating given by others instead of the predicted rating for me. I&rsquo;ve taken to hovering over each film&rsquo;s title or image to get that information. It&rsquo;s annoying but doable and I prefer it to the misleading red stars.</p>
<p>Recently when Liz was away for a few weeks, I had a plan to watch a bunch of action flicks and such-like that I wanted to see and knew the she wouldn&rsquo;t want to see. Not that she isn&rsquo;t into action films; the other day we greatly enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Inglourious%20Basterds&amp;tag=thapnasasbl-20&amp;index=blended&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Inglourious Basterds</a>. So I browsed for those films that I had heard of and those that folks recommended, added them to my queue, and moved them to the top. Soon enough they started showing up and I had a great time catching up on that genre. Now that Liz is back, the queue is as it was before she left and I&rsquo;m faced with a slight problem. When I come across a film in the aforementioned genre, I would like to store it for another similar time in the future. However, I can&rsquo;t just add it to my queue without constant annoying maintenance. I&rsquo;d like a feature using which I can make a list of movies called “Sam&rsquo;s Must-See Action Flix”. When Liz travels, I can make this list my active queue in one click. And then one-click should return the active queue to the regularly scheduled list when she returns. Simple.</p>
<p>The “Watch Instantly” feature of streaming movies is most excellent. I love it, despite the fact that it causes my browser to crash once each time I use it. I&rsquo;ve been using it to see movies I&rsquo;ve enjoyed before but not seen in a long time and also for those times when you just want to see something right away but aren&rsquo;t in the mood for the DVD lying on the table. It would be most awesome if it worked directly with my PlayStation 3 but from what I&rsquo;ve read that is not likely to happen anytime soon.</p>
