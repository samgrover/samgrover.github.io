Here are some personally memorable events since my last birthday post:

	December - Liz and I traveled to Asia. In India, we had our New Delhi wedding. In Nepal we visited Liz&#39;s home and friends in the Himalayas and in Bali we had our honeymoon. Pictures are [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/collections/72157618568809607/).
	January - Returned from trip to Asia. Bought a HDTV and a PS3. Been enjoying glorious Blu-Ray and some cool games since then.
	February - Started working on Avatari. My first Mac application in Cocoa. Had my first car accident. It was minor.
	April - Demoed and released [Avatari](https://samgrover.com/software/) at Demolicious. Liz and I went road-tripping thru the southwest. Visited Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, Monument Valley and Grand Canyon. Some of the most amazing landscapes I&#39;ve ever seen. Pictures are [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157618655198144/).
	May - Liz and I went to Bend for a long weekend and had a great time exploring this cute little town and its surrounding volcanic geology.
	June - I became a [US permanent resident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_residence_%28United_States%29). No more visa hassles!
	August - Liz and I traveled to Kaua&#39;i where we had a great time celebrating our first anniversary. Pictures are [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157622166004781/).
	September - Completed ten years of living in the US. Brought [Yoshi](https://blog.samgrover.com/2009/09/29/yoshi/) (our cat) home. My first pet ever. Bought an Olympus E-P1 to use as my primary camera succeeding the Bessa in that role.

It was an amazing year and I’m looking forward to the next one.
