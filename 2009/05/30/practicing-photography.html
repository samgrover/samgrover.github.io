<h1>Practicing Photography</h1>

May. 30, 2009


<br/><br/>
<p>Mike Johnston, over at <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/">T.O.P</a>, writes interesting posts quite often. He has recently written a couple of them that hit close to home. They are <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/05/a-leica-year.html">The Leica as Teacher</a> and <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/05/why-it-has-to-be-a-leica.html">Why It Has To Be a Leica</a>. Mike suggests a training program using the Leica for a year to shoot <abbr title="Black and White">B&amp;W</abbr> film extensively and to edit and critique oneself on the photos taken. I&rsquo;ve tried to do exactly that over the last two years.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/423814367" title="View 'Meetup spirit' on Flickr.com">![](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/174/423814367_99f7c65e86.jpg)</a></div>
<p>There are some differences, of course. My camera has been a <a href="http://blog.samgrover.com/2008/01/19/one-year-with-a-voigtlander-bessa-r2a-rangefinder/">Bessa R2A</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using only that camera with a 50mm prime lens since January 2007. The Bessa is like a cheaper version of a Leica. Most of the points that Mike mentions in the second post apply to the Bessa too.</p>
<p>Certainly, I haven&rsquo;t been as prolific as Mike suggests. Much has happened in my life since then and other interests have sometimes taken priority in spare time. As of today I have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/tags/voigtlandernokton50mmf15/">362 photos on Flickr</a> taken with this camera and lens pair. That&rsquo;s an average of about three selected photos per week, although in reality there were bursts of activity when I was on vacation. About half of those photos are B&amp;W. I typically haven&rsquo;t thought in terms of color unless it felt quite essential, and have preferred B&amp;W film for the most part.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/1429078633" title="View 'Michael rolls a cigarette' on Flickr.com">![](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1096/1429078633_aaf15ea785.jpg)</a></div>
<p>The gist of the matter is that this is a really good exercise. In the end, like Mike says,</p>
<blockquote>Because make no mistake, photographing the way I suggested in the previous post is the photographic equivalent of being a top athlete: it takes dedication and coordination and talent and time and sacrifice and lots of training.</blockquote>
<p>This gels with what Malcolm Gladwell has written in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316036692?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thapnasasbl-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0316036692">Outliers</a> and with my own experience. What matters most is that you put a lot of time and effort into it. The constraints Mike suggests help to make the exercise even more focused, pun unintended. It&rsquo;s definitely not the only exercise out there but I sincerely believe that if you were to do this, it would greatly benefit your photographic eye. I can surely feel it and perhaps my photography shows it.</p>

<p>When I started using my Bessa, I dumped my DSLR and haven&rsquo;t missed it since. Having said that, I think I&rsquo;m getting weary of having a film based workflow as my primary one. I&rsquo;m still hoping that a nice digital rangefinder will come along or that I will find it reasonable to invest in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IM3W0E?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thapnasasbl-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B001IM3W0E">Leica M8</a>. Until then I may try the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W3429E?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thapnasasbl-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B001W3429E">Sigma DP2</a>. It looks quite promising. I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out for the news and reviews and look at photos from it for a couple of months before deciding.</p>
