<p>Yea, the last few posts on this blog have all been about Avatari. Life, as usual, is way more varied. Here&rsquo;s a recap of some travels and photos from the last few months.</p>
<p>Late last year, Liz and I traveled to Asia. We visited her Nepalese home near Kathmandu, had our second wedding of the year in New Delhi and then went to Bali for our honeymoon. That&rsquo;s a whole &rsquo;nother blog post that one of us will eventually write on <a href="http://samandliz.wordpress.com/">our blog</a>. Oh, but the pictures are ready to go in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/collections/72157618568809607/">Asia 2008 collection</a> on Flickr.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/3176230852" title="View 'Village girl' on Flickr.com">![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3374/3176230852_b0399bb192.jpg)</a></div>
<p>Our first trip this year was during the last week of April. Liz and I went on a road trip in the Colorado plateau area. We flew in to Las Vegas and drove to Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park. It was an amazing set of places to see with wondrous natural landscapes; the product of water, stone and time. We spent four nights camping and three in hotels. An exploration of that trip will also be in <a href="http://samandliz.wordpress.com/">our blog</a> soon, I promise! Once again, the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157618655198144/">photos are ready</a> :-)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/3550092353" title="View 'Us at Mather Point' on Flickr.com">![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3342/3550092353_7dd574b22f.jpg)</a></div>
<p>These two trips have been my primary outlet in taking photos over the past several months. I&rsquo;m quite happy with the resulting pictures. I am, however, starting to feel tired of using film and the related workflow and cost. I hope I can make the transition to a decent digital rangefinder sometime over the next year or so although I will have to save up for one of those!</p>

<p>Tomorrow Liz and I will be going to Bend in central Oregon for this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day">Memorial Day</a> weekend and I&rsquo;m hoping to explore new places and take a bunch of more photos. So, stay tuned for those!</p>
<p>I have a couple more ideas for blog posts so hopefully the next one will be sooner rather than later. In the meanwhile, feel free to follow along at <a href="http://twitter.com/samgrover">@samgrover</a> where I can be found posting much more frequently.</p>
