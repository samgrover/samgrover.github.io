It&rsquo;s been another good year of reading. A few interesting notes:

Thankful to the Multnomah County Library system for borrowing about half of them, including the nice physical copy of How to See.
A couple were public domain books from the wonderful Standard Ebooks project. I will be returning to pick from there again for sure.
I listened to my first ever audiobook, The Silmarillion. It was a great book for that format as it was written like a mythology and that might have lost my interest if I were to read it. Also, there were lots of interesting names that I would&rsquo;ve surely pronounced badly.
A good balance of fiction/non-fiction and genres therein really kept my interest going, just like I had mused about a year ago.

The full list is on the books page." />
