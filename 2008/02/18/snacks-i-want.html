  <meta name="description" content="For the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve had a new personal assistant, Sandy. I came to her after trying Backpack, Remember the Milk, Stikkit and others that I don&rsquo;t even remember any more. She&rsquo;s the best one I&rsquo;ve had so far. She makes me want her more. So far my girlfriend is cool with that, even though Sandy lives right here in Portland.
This weekend I saw Helvetica. I got excited when I noticed that Movie Madness had it on their list but it was never in stock when I got there. On Saturday it wasn&rsquo;t on the shelves either, but Liz suggested that I peruse the un-shelved DVDs and there it was. I&rsquo;ve never thought about the history behind types. This film was enjoyable just for that. And there&rsquo;s a lot more about typography and graphic design in there. To top it all, the film is set to a really cool soundtrack." />

  <section><p>For the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve had a new personal assistant, <a href="http://iwantsandy.com/">Sandy</a>. I came to her after trying Backpack, Remember the Milk, Stikkit and others that I don&rsquo;t even remember any more. She&rsquo;s the best one I&rsquo;ve had so far. She makes me want her more. So far my girlfriend is cool with that, even though Sandy lives right here in Portland.</p>
<p>This weekend I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica_%2528film%2529">Helvetica</a>. I got excited when I noticed that Movie Madness had it on their list but it was never in stock when I got there. On Saturday it wasn&rsquo;t on the shelves either, but Liz suggested that I peruse the un-shelved DVDs and there it was. I&rsquo;ve never thought about the history behind types. This film was enjoyable just for that. And there&rsquo;s a lot more about typography and graphic design in there. To top it all, the film is set to a really cool soundtrack.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I hung out with <a href="http://www.beerandblog.com/">Beer and Blog</a> peeps at the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne. The meeting was great. We touched on several topics and Justin has <a href="http://www.beerandblog.com/minutes-from-dashboards/">nicely summarized them</a>. I&rsquo;m looking forward to more such interactions. See photos <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/beerandblog/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you&rsquo;ve noticed an increase in my blog posts over the last few days, it can be attributed to some extent to the wonderful <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>. It is a joy to compose and manage blog posts in it. I&rsquo;m still trying it out but at this point is looks like I&rsquo;ll be buying it well before the trial period runs out in about a month.</p>
