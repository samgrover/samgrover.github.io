<p>There&rsquo;s plenty going on.</p>
<p>My sister and her daughter came by to visit me from India last month. They were here for about a week and we all had a great time going around the Portland metro area and nearby to the gorge and coast. Here they are at Cannon Beach.</p>

Around the end of May, my landlord and I had a disagreement on the terms for a lease renewal at my current place. So, I decided to move out and started looking for a new place. I found a nice two bedroom condo [right by the river](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=620+NW+Naito+Pkwy,+Portland+OR+97209&amp;mrt=all&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=45.528178,-122.672825&amp;spn=0.009275,0.017252&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr) in NW Portland and will be moving there this weekend.
<p>I got a paper accepted to a conference called <a href="http://secrypt.org/">SECRYPT</a>. I will be going to present it at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto">Porto, Portugal</a> during the last few days of July. I just applied for a Visa and am looking forward to my first trip to Europe.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.igniteportland.com/">Ignite Portland</a> 3 happened last night. This time Liz was a speaker. She spoke about her experiences of traveling to Afghanistan. She has a ton of stories and did an excellent job of squeezing a five minute rapid fire inspirational talk from them. There was a good variety of topics, just like at the last Ignite Portland, which made the evening quite entertaining. This time we went to the after party at <a href="http://www.takeitin.com/">Imbibe</a> and had a great time with friends, old and new. You can see her slides and video right here. They go quite well together.</p>

<p>And lastly for now, Liz and I decided to start a blog together to document our adventures. I kicked it off tonight with a basic theme and a first post about <a href="http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/06/19/contact/">how we met</a>. Check it out and subscribe for more stories in the future.</p>
