It has been a little over eight months since I [bought the Wii](http://blog.samgrover.com/2008/03/16/time-to-play-again/). Even though my best video game experiences have been on a PC, the Wii holds its own and is a pleasure to play.
I started with the wonderful Super Mario Galaxy and it was the only Wii game I played until a couple of months ago. Then, for five days each, I rented Transformers, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, one after another. And although I didn&rsquo;t really get in to Brawl, I thoroughly enjoyed the other two." />

It has been a little over eight months since I [bought the Wii](http://blog.samgrover.com/2008/03/16/time-to-play-again/). Even though my best video game experiences have been on a PC, the Wii holds its own and is a pleasure to play.
<p>I started with the wonderful Super Mario Galaxy and it was the only Wii game I played until a couple of months ago. Then, for five days each, I rented Transformers, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, one after another. And although I didn&rsquo;t really get in to Brawl, I thoroughly enjoyed the other two.</p>
<p>Then came October, and my awesome mother-in-law completely surprised me with two Wii games for my birthday. Pirates of the Carribean: At World&rsquo;s End and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Both are based on movies that I haven&rsquo;t seen. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed The Mummy more than Pirates.</p>
<p>Then came November, and keeping in mind that Liz and I will be off to Asia during Christmas, my mom-in-law sent our presents early. Guess what I got, among other things? Yea, that&rsquo;s right, two more Wii games! Iron Man and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Each based on a movie that I have seen multiple times. Awesome! I haven&rsquo;t played Fantastic Four yet, but Iron Man has been fun so far.</p>
<p>Next week Liz and I leave for a vacation to Asia, but when I&rsquo;m back in January, I&rsquo;ll sure have a bunch of Wii games to play :)</p>
