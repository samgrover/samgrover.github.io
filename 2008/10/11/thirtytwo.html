  <meta name="description" content="I&rsquo;ve never blogged about my birthday before, which is strange because I&rsquo;ve had thirty-one of them. A few seconds ago I turned thirty-two.
Here are some personally memorable events since my last birthday:

	October - Made a trip to India for dad&#39;s 60th birthday celebration.
	January - Got all four of my wisdom teeth extracted. Two had to be dug out. Was on a soup diet for a couple of weeks.
	February - Created the first version of the [LazyEngine](http://lazyengine.appspot.com/).
	March - Asked Liz to marry me. She said yes. Bought a Wii. The engagement was decidedly more memorable, but the Wii has been fun too :-)
	April - Attended a concert by Zakir Hussain and met him.
	May - Went to the hot springs at Brietenbush. Sis and niece came over to visit. We all had a great time.
	June - Moved to a new place right next to the river in NW Portland. Liz spoke at Ignite Portland 3.
	July - Liz and I made a [trip to Maine](http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/our-trip-to-maine/) to visit her parents and to spend the 4th of July holiday with them. Later that month, I traveled to Porto, Portugal to attend a conference. Lovely little city. It was my first time in Europe.
	August - Liz and I had our [Portland wedding](http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/we-got-married/). Our New Delhi wedding is in December. We went to Crater Lake for a weekend. Beautiful place. Our first time there. I traveled to San Francisco to showcase my work.
	September - I hacked together [ff2tweet](http://github.com/samgrover/ff2tweet/tree/master). Hope to refine it further in the future.

It was a wonderful year and I&#39;m looking forward to the next one.
And lastly, here&rsquo;s more about the number 32." />
