<p>I bought it along with a 50mm Nokton f/1.5 lens and an adapter. The camera has an M mount, whereas the lens is a screw mount, so I needed an adapter. My plan was that if I liked this enough I could get an M mount Leica lens in the future and it would fit just fine with the camera. I still plan on doing that. Perhaps a 35mm lens, but more on that later. I bought this Bessa at <a href="http://cameraquest.com/voigtr2ar3a.htm">CameraQuest</a>, a website that I haven&rsquo;t visited since then. I never planned on buying more of this system and I never had any issues.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/525781647/" title="Awaiting summer by samgrover, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1066/525781647_5b7580102c_m.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>My <a href="http://samgrover.com/2006/05/early-experience-with-a-rangef.php">early experience with a rangefinder</a> camera was in 2006 when I borrowed a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/tags/canonetql17giii/show/" class="Plain">Canonet QL17 G-III</a> from my friend <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/old_sarge/">Doug</a>. At the end of that month I was hooked and understood why the rangefinder is the best camera for street photography. A sentiment expressed by many a famous street photographers of the last century. My favorite part about a rangefinder is that since I can see the frame lines, I can see the things that I&rsquo;m not including in the frame. You can never do that with an SLR. That allows me to frame the shot best, especially on the street when I have only a fraction of a second to frame and shoot a photo. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about focusing because I pre-focus and set a high depth-of-field. When I bring the camera to my eye, all I have to do is frame and click. And I love it when the camera goes &ldquo;click&rdquo;. The Bessa has a quick sharp sound that is barely noticeable as compared to the extended louder sound of the DSLR.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of the rangefinder is that you can see the photo at the moment of exposure, while in the SLR you just see nothing. As a result, at the beginning, my timing was  a bit off with this camera, but not only did I get used to it, I started to love it. Most of the time I take a photo, I just click one frame. No second chance. So it helps to know if I got what I was going for, even though the suspense remains until I actually get the film processed.</p>

<p>Over the last year I&rsquo;ve put up 193 photos taken with this camera on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/">my Flickr photostream</a>, about 76% of all my uploaded photos for 2007. That&rsquo;s not an immense number and probably would&rsquo;ve been even smaller had I not made the trips to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157602125513976/show/">Burning Man</a> and to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157603288998293/show/">India</a>. I put up 481 photos in 2006 and 807 photos in 2005. I think the trend is down because the cost of using film has made me frugal.</p>
<p>I like using film because of the texture that it imparts to a photograph. I haven&rsquo;t experimented a whole lot with different films, and settled quite early with Tri-X. Most of the time I push it to ISO 1600 and gives me just the right kind of contrast I like. It also helps to push the film in Portland, since most days are overcast and higher ISO films cost more ;-) Having said that, more and more manufacturers of are moving out of the 35mm film market. That trend has me thinking of digital rangefinders for the future. We&rsquo;ll see how that goes.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve spent enough time with the 50mm lens to now explore more primes. I would prefer to go wider, as that&rsquo;s what I find lacking sometimes when I frame a shot. Also, I think it would help me get closer while out on the street. So, sometime this year, I&rsquo;ll get a 35mm M mount lens, hopefully a Leica one. After all, that was the plan :-)</p>
