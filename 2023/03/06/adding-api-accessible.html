<h1>Adding API Accessible Devices to the Home Climate Monitoring Setup</h1>

Mar. 6, 2023


<br/><br/>
<p>I was thinking about getting more of those AcuRite sensors for expanding my <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/03/01/home-climate-monitoring.html">home climate monitoring</a> when I realized that I already have a couple of devices recording this and other data.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/346875b7ca.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/346875b7ca.png" alt="Screenshot showing charts of temperature, humidity, and air quality time series."></a></p>
<p>These include my <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZnOfFX">Ecobee Thermostat and Remote Sensor</a> and my <a href="https://amzn.to/41MeiIK">IQAir AirVisual Pro</a>. Both of these have means of getting the data off of them using an API. This <a href="https://den.dev/blog/air/">blog post</a> by Den Delimarsky really helped with the IQAir API. <a href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/developers/">Ecobee API</a> was straightforward. And after some coding and testing, I had a couple of scripts running that could pull metrics from them and send them to <code>influxdb</code>. So now I have a few more data points for existing metrics, and have added air quality to it.</p>
<p>In the previous blog post , I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iâ€™m going to take a break from any further optimizing/tweaking for now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that didn&rsquo;t happen! But maybe now ðŸ¤”</p>
<p>P.S. The screenshot above illustrates a few other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>How I got the scripts going in starts and stops as I figured out the issues in having them always running.</li>
<li>A macOS update that I started before heading out for a few hours, which led to a large gap because I still have all of this on my desktop Mac.</li>
<li>The dots show how some data was reduced in granularity overnight because of device settings that put it to sleep. So I changed those settings the next day.</li>
</ul>
