<h1>Home Climate Monitoring</h1>

Mar. 1, 2023


<br/><br/>
<p>Sometime last year my friend Andrew made me aware of the sensors and software he was using to monitor temperature and humidity in his home. I thought that was cool and it introduced me to several hardware and software tools that I had not known about. I wanted to set this up at my home so I filed a project for a later date.</p>
<p>Well, that day arrived a few weeks ago and here&rsquo;s what it looks like today:</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/7387c64251.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/7387c64251.png" alt="Screenshot showing charts of temperature and humidity time series."></a></p>
<p>To get started exploring this I purchased an <a href="https://amzn.to/3ky05hO">AcuRite bundle</a> of three sensor towers and one display. I set up the towers around my home and put the display in my home office. It was neat to see the display showing the measurements at any given time. Soon I wanted to go to the next level and record and see the data over time.</p>
<p>These sensors broadcast the data over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPD433">433 MHz</a> and there are consumer level antennas and software available to read this data. I bought a <a href="https://amzn.to/3Y6Ew5x">NooElec bundle</a> which gave me all the hardware I needed to receive this data on my computer. Setting it up was straightforward. I used <a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433">rtl_433</a> and was able to start seeing the wireless data immediately in the terminal on my Mac.</p>
<p>The next step was storing all this data. That&rsquo;s where <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb">influxdb</a> came in. And the glue to get it from <code>rtl_433</code> to <code>influxdb</code> involved <a href="https://mqtt.org">MQTT</a> and <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf">telegraf</a>.</p>
<p>There was a lot of trial and error but I finally got it all set up and was able to get the data into <code>influxdb</code>. I even made a dashboard in there to visualize it. The options on that dashboard were limited so I got <a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana">grafana</a> set up and built a dashboard in that which can be seen at the top of this post as seen on my desktop browser. It also looks great on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Except for <code>rtl_433</code>, the rest of the tools all run on docker on my desktop Mac. At some point I may migrate that off to a Raspberry Pi but for now it&rsquo;s all working and I&rsquo;m going to take a break from any further optimizing/tweaking for now.</p>
<p><strong>Update (6th March, 2023):</strong> <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/03/06/adding-api-accessible.html">Follow up post</a> about expanding on this effort.</p>
