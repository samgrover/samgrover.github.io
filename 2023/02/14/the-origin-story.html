<h1>The Origin Story of Walmart Labs in Portland</h1>

Feb. 14, 2023


<br/><br/>
<p>Today I came across this <a href="https://siliconflorist.com/2023/02/14/walmart-is-shuttering-walmart-labs-office-in-portland/">Silicon Florist article</a> about the closing of the Walmart office in Portland. It&rsquo;s definitely the end of an era.</p>
<p>After reading it, I couldn&rsquo;t help but clarify a few things about the origin story ðŸ˜¬</p>
<p>Quoting from the article,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a town that has been less than welcoming to Walmart, it may be a bit of head-scratcher how they wound up with a regional technology office here. The answer, like so many other regional offices in town, is through acquisition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Acquisition, yes, but not the one of Small Society as the article alludes.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/walmart-labs-acquires-set-direction--9ff4c45b">April 2011</a>, <a href="https://almaer.com/blog/helping-set-direction-at-walmart">Walmart Labs acquired Set Direction</a> which had been building the Walmart iOS app, and more. At the time Set Direction had one employee WFH in Portland. Next month I joined the team.</p>
<p>A short while later we hired a third person and rented a conference room at <a href="https://collectiveagency.co">Collective Agency&rsquo;s</a> first location in NW Portland. When our team expanded to five people over a couple more months, we moved into the first proper Walmart Labs office at <a href="http://www.theonemainplace.com">One Main Place</a> in November 2011. During that time we built and released the first few versions of the native iOS SDK based Walmart app.</p>
<p>Quoting again from the article,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After being acquired in 2012, Small Society took on the moniker of Walmart Labs, serving as a regional technology office for the retail giant and continued to be a presence â€” albeit a much quieter presence â€” within the local startup community, even taking up residence in coworking spaces around town.</p></blockquote>
<p>Walmart Labs existed in Portland for the better part of a year before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/04/walmartlabs-acquires-mobile-agency-small-society/">the Small Society acquisition in January 2012</a>. And while Walmart Labs worked out of a coworking space for a few months, Small Society (as part of Walmart Labs) never did. After the acquisition they continued to operate from their existing office.</p>
<p>For eight months Walmart Labs was split across two offices until we all moved into the space above the erstwhile Rock Bottom Brewery (2nd and Morrison) in September 2012.</p>
<p>Edited to clarify: During recent years Walmart Labs did move into a coworking space but that was long after all the original people had moved on.</p>
