<h1>You can now become a Mimi Uploader Supporter via an ongoing in-app subscription üôè</h1>

Dec. 21, 2023


<br/><br/>
<p>The latest version of Mimi Uploader is now out in the App Store. It has an option to subscribe on an ongoing basis to become a Supporter.</p>
<p>By becoming a Supporter, you are providing for the development and maintenance of the app on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>In the future, this will also provide access to features that have ongoing costs. You may have heard that the newest beta of the app has a feature for <a href="https://samgrover.com/2023/12/15/mimi-uploader-enters.html">generating image description for alt text</a>. This is powered by a third-party API and will be the first of such features.</p>
<p>You can sign up to support on the Settings screen by selecting the option labeled, &ldquo;Become a Supporter&rdquo;. There are three levels of payment. Pick the level that works for you. Whatever level you pick, you get the same access. And for all levels, you have my gratitude.</p>
<p>Get Mimi Uploader from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">App Store</a>!</p>
